# Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceInformation

## -description

Represents a device. This class allows access to well-known device properties as well as additional properties specified during device enumeration.

## -remarks

A DeviceInformation object is composed of an identity ([DeviceInformation.Id](deviceinformation_id.md)), a kind ([DeviceInformation.Kind](deviceinformation_kind.md)), and a property bag ([DeviceInformation.Properties](deviceinformation_properties.md)). All of the other properties of a DeviceInformation object are derived from the [Properties](deviceinformation_properties.md) property bag. For example, [Name](deviceinformation_name.md) is derived from **System.ItemNameDisplay**.

Successful completion of [FindAllAsync](deviceinformation_findallasync_1257462890.md) results in a [DeviceInformationCollection](deviceinformationcollection.md) containing DeviceInformation objects.

If a call to [CreateWatcher](deviceinformation_createwatcher_1506431823.md) succeeds, a DeviceInformation object is passed to the [added](devicewatcher_added.md) event for each device that is found.

The [Name](deviceinformation_name.md) property should only be used for display purposes only and not for finding a device because the [Name](deviceinformation_name.md) can change due to localization or a user assigning a name.

[CreateFromIdAsync](deviceinformation_createfromidasync_270724983.md) creates a DeviceInformation object if successful.

The DeviceInformation class provides device information, but more specifically, it provides properties of the device interface, the interface that represents functionality that the device exposes. Multi-function devices may have more than one device interface. The physical object that a user sees as a device, is known as the device container, and has properties such as **Manufacturer** and **ModelID**. For more information about enumerating devices and recovering properties, see [Enumerate devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/enumerate-devices).

## -examples

This example incrementally enumerates devices, adding them to a list each time a device is found, and also handling removals and updates.
