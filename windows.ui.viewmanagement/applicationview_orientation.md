# Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView.Orientation

## -description
Gets the current orientation (landscape or portrait) of the window (app view) with respect to the display.

## -property-value
The current orientation of the calling window.

## -remarks
For an example of using the [Orientation](applicationview_isscreencaptureenabled.md) property, see the [Application Views](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Windows%208.1%20Store%20app%20samples/99866-Windows%208.1%20Store%20app%20samples/Application%20Views) sample.

The property is a nonstatic member of the window object. For JavaScript, this means that it is a method of the window object that [getForCurrentView](applicationview_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) creates, not of the [ApplicationView](applicationview.md) class.
