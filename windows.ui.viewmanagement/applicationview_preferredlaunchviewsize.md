# Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchViewSize

## -description
Gets or sets the size that the app launches with when the [ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchWindowingMode](applicationview_preferredlaunchwindowingmode.md) property is set to **PreferredLaunchViewSize**, except in cases where the system manages the window size directly.

## -property-value
The size that the app launches with when the [ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchWindowingMode](applicationview_preferredlaunchwindowingmode.md) property is set to **PreferredLaunchViewSize**, except in cases where the system manages the window size directly.

## -remarks
This property only has an effect when the app is launched on a desktop device that is not in Tablet mode.

For the very first launch of an app the [PreferredLaunchWindowingMode](applicationview_preferredlaunchwindowingmode.md) will always be **Auto** and the ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchViewSize will be determined by system policies. The API applies to the next launch of the app.
