# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.ArcSegment

## -description
Represents an elliptical arc between two points.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<ArcSegmentÂ .../>
```


## -remarks
At a minimum each ArcSegment should have its [RotationAngle](arcsegment_rotationangle.md) and [Size](arcsegment_size.md) properties set, because these don't have useful defaults.

This class is relevant for setting the vector data for either a [Path](../windows.ui.xaml.shapes/path.md) or a [PathIcon](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/pathicon.md).

Rather than creating an instance or an object element, you can also define an ArcSegment as part of a vector within the string for a [Move and draw commands syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/move-draw-commands-syntax).
