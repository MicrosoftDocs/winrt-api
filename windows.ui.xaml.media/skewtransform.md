# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.SkewTransform

## -description
Represents a two-dimensional skew.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<SkewTransformÂ .../>
```


## -remarks

## -examples
This example uses a SkewTransform to skew text. A *skew*, also known as a *shear*, is a transformation that stretches the coordinate space in a non-uniform manner. In this example, the two text strings are skewed -30 degrees and 30 degrees along the x-coordinate.

The text looks like this after the transform is applied:

This example shows how you can access and modify a transform in code at runtime. Each time the rectangle is pressed, the skew is increased.
