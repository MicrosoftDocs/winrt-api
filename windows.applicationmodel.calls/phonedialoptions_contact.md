# Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.PhoneDialOptions.Contact

## -description
Gets or sets the address book contact associated with a dial request.

## -property-value
The address book contact associated with a dial request.

## -remarks
If you are supplying an [IContact](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa912125.aspx) as the Contact, then you need to make sure it is a component contact and not an aggregate contact. This will make sure that the correct contact is reached when you attempt to place a call using these [PhoneDialOptions](phonedialoptions.md). Otherwise, the additional information in the contact will be lost and a lookup will be performed using only the number. This might result in the incorrect contact being selected if multiple contacts share the same number but have different metadata.
