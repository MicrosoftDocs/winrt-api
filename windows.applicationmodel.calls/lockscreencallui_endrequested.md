# Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.LockScreenCallUI.EndRequested

## -description
**Deprecated.** Occurs when the lock screen wants to end the call.

## -remarks
The [EndRequested](lockscreencallui_endrequested.md) event typically happens when the user taps the “End call” button on the lock screen, but the event can also happen under other conditions. For example, suppose a call comes in while a call is already active on the lock screen. By accepting the new call on the lock screen, the previous call ends.

When the [EndRequested](lockscreencallui_endrequested.md) event handler returns, the app is removed from the lock screen. An app can extend its time on the lock screen by calling [LockScreenCallEndRequestedEventArgs.GetDeferral](lockscreencallendrequestedeventargs_getdeferral_254836512.md) to request a deferral. If the app requested a deferral, the app is removed from the lock screen when the deferral completes or the deadline passes.
