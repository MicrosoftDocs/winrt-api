# Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.LockScreenCallUI.Dismiss

## -description
Removes the app from the lock screen UI.

## -remarks
An app calls [Dismiss](lockscreencallui_dismiss.md) to remove itself when the call is dropped, for example, the other party hangs up. When [Dismiss](lockscreencallui_dismiss.md) returns, the lock screen no longer shows the app.
