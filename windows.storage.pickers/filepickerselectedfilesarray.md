# Windows.Storage.Pickers.FilePickerSelectedFilesArray

## -description
Represents a collection of storage files that the user has selected by using a file picker.

## -remarks
When a call to the [fileOpenPicker.pickMultipleFilesAsync](fileopenpicker_pickmultiplefilesasync_1324933367.md) method completes successfully, it returns a filePickerSelectedFilesArray object that contains all the files that were picked by the user. Picked files in this array are represented by [storageFile](../windows.storage/storagefile.md) objects.

### Collection member lists

For JavaScript, FilePickerSelectedFilesArray has the members shown in the member lists. In addition, FilePickerSelectedFilesArray supports a **length** property, members of **Array.prototype**, and using an index to access items.


<!--Begin NET note for IEnumerable support-->
### Enumerating the collection in C# or Microsoft Visual Basic

FilePickerSelectedFilesArray is enumerable, so you can use language-specific syntax such as **foreach** in C# to enumerate the items in the collection. The compiler does the type-casting for you and you won't need to cast to `IEnumerable<StorageFile>` explicitly. If you do need to cast explicitly, for example if you want to call [GetEnumerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable.getenumerator?redirectedfrom=MSDN#System_Collections_IEnumerable_GetEnumerator), cast to [IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable?redirectedfrom=MSDN) with a [StorageFile](../windows.storage/storagefile.md) constraint.

## -examples
The [File picker sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/FilePicker) demonstrates how capture the filePickerSelectedFilesArray (`files` in the example) of picked files after calling [fileOpenPicker.pickMultipleFilesAsync](fileopenpicker_pickmultiplefilesasync_1324933367.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You should always make sure that your app is not snapped (or that it can be unsnapped) and set file picker properties regardless of whether the user is picking a single file or multiple files.
