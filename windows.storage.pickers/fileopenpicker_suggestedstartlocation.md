# Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker.SuggestedStartLocation

## -description
Gets or sets the initial location where the file open picker looks for files to present to the user.

## -property-value
The identifier of the starting location.

## -remarks
The [SuggestedStartLocation](fileopenpicker_suggestedstartlocation.md) is not always used as the start location for the file picker. To give the user a sense of consistency, the file picker remembers the last location that the user navigated to and will generally start at that location.
