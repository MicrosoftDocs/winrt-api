## -description
Gets or sets the initial location where the folder picker looks for folders to present to the user.

## -property-value

The SuggestedStartLocation is not always used as the start location for the folder picker. To give the user a sense of consistency, the folder picker remembers the last location that the user navigated to and will generally start at that location.
