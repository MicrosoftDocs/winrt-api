## -description

Asynchronously configures the system to allow connections from the remote audio source.

## -returns

An asynchronous operation.

## -remarks

This method informs the system that there is a new application that wants audio from the remote device to be played on the local device. But audio does not play until the connection has been opened with a call to [Open](audioplaybackconnection_open_389234318.md) or [OpenAsync](audioplaybackconnection_openasync_171309613.md).

## -see-also
