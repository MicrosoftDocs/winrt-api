# InkInputProcessingMode

## -description
Specifies how the [InkPresenter](inkpresenter.md) object interprets input from it's associated [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) control.

By default, input is handled as standard ink or erase strokes, or it can be passed as [UnprocessedInput](inkpresenter_unprocessedinput.md) to your app for custom processing.

## -enum-fields
### -field None:0
All input events are passed to the app and are not processed by the [InkPresenter](inkpresenter.md).

### -field Inking:1
Input is treated as ink.

### -field Erasing:2
Input is treated as erase.


## -remarks
If [Mode](inkinputprocessingconfiguration_mode.md) is set to **None**, the value of [RightDragAction](inkinputprocessingconfiguration_rightdragaction.md) is ignored and input is always passed as [UnprocessedInput](inkpresenter_unprocessedinput.md) through to your app for custom processing.

If [Mode](inkinputprocessingconfiguration_mode.md) is set to **Inking** or **Erasing**, the value of [RightDragAction](inkinputprocessingconfiguration_rightdragaction.md) must be set to [LeaveUnprocessed](inkinputrightdragaction.md) to pass input as [UnprocessedInput](inkpresenter_unprocessedinput.md) through to your app for custom processing.

To manage how secondary input is processed by your app, see [InkInputProcessingConfiguration](inkinputprocessingconfiguration.md).
