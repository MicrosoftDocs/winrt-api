# Windows.UI.Input.Inking.InkPresenter.ActivateCustomDrying

## -description
Indicates that your app requires complete control of ink input rendering it to the Direct2D device context of your Universal Windows app, instead of the default [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) control. This requires an [IInkD2DRenderer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d1bd910d-ce64-4424-a0e1-4f55110b0265) object to manage the ink input (see the [Complex ink sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=620314)).

By default, ink input is processed on a low-latency background thread and rendered "wet" as it is drawn. When the stroke is completed (pen or finger lifted, or mouse button released), the stroke is processed on the UI thread and rendered "dry" to the [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) layer (above the application content and replacing the wet ink).

By calling [ActivateCustomDrying](inkpresenter_activatecustomdrying.md) (before the [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) is loaded), an app creates an [InkSynchronizer](inksynchronizer.md) object to customize how an ink stroke is rendered dry to a [SurfaceImageSource](../windows.ui.xaml.media.imaging/surfaceimagesource.md) or [VirtualSurfaceImageSource](../windows.ui.xaml.media.imaging/virtualsurfaceimagesource.md). For example, an ink stroke could be rasterized and integrated into application content instead of as a separate [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) layer. This also provides improved performance for a large, or complex, collection of ink strokes.

## -returns
The object used for custom ink stroke rendering.

## -remarks
#### Error codes
##### E_ILLEGAL_METHOD_CALL  (0x8000000E)
Thrown if [ActivateCustomDrying](inkpresenter_activatecustomdrying.md) is called after [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) is loaded.

This method must be called prior to loading the [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md).

> **Custom drying and the InkToolbar**
> By default, ink input is processed on a low-latency background thread and rendered "wet" as it is drawn. When the stroke is completed (pen or finger lifted, or mouse button released), the stroke is processed on the UI thread and rendered "dry" to the [InkCanvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inkcanvas.md) layer (above the application content and replacing the wet ink). The ink platform enables you to override this behavior and completely customize the inking experience by custom drying the ink input.

If your app overrides the default ink rendering behavior of the [InkPresenter](inkpresenter.md) with a custom drying implementation, the rendered ink strokes are no longer available to the [InkToolbar](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inktoolbar.md) and the built-in erase commands of the [InkToolbar](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/inktoolbar.md) do not work as expected. To provide erase functionality, you must handle all pointer events, perform hit-testing on each stroke, and override the built-in "Erase all ink" command.
