# Windows.Services.Store.StoreContext.UninstallStorePackageByStoreIdAsync

## -description
Uninstalls the specified downloadable content (DLC) package for the current app without displaying a notification UI dialog to the user.

## -parameters
### -param storeId
The Store ID of the add-on that corresponds to the DLC package to uninstall for the current app.

## -returns
An asynchronous operation that, on successful completion, returns a [StoreUninstallStorePackageResult](storeuninstallstorepackageresult.md) object that provides info about the uninstall operation.

## -remarks
You can use this method to free up disk space by uninstalling DLC packages that are no longer needed. For example, a game that offers both a single player campaign and a multiplayer campaign might use this method to uninstall the single player campaign at the user's request, after the user has completed that campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> DLC packages are not available to all developer accounts.

When you call this method, the OS silently uninstalls the package without displaying a notification dialog. This method requires the restricted **storePackageManagement** capability to perform this operation. If you don't have access to this restricted capability, you can use the [RequestUninstallStorePackageAsync](storecontext_requestuninstallstorepackageasync_1329597038.md) or [RequestUninstallStorePackageByStoreIdAsync](storecontext_requestuninstallstorepackagebystoreidasync_1267943069.md) methods instead (these methods display a notification dialog that requests the user's permission to uninstall the package).

> [!NOTE]
> The restricted **storePackageManagement** capability is only available to desktop applications and games that use the [Desktop Bridge](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/bridges/desktop) and to Xbox games that use XVC packages and are developed as part of a managed partner program, such as the [ID@Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/developers/id) program. These applications and games have this capability by default.

The Store ID for an add-on is available in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard), and it also is returned by the [StoreId](storeproduct_storeid.md) property of the [StoreProduct](storeproduct.md) that represents the add-on. For more information, see [Store IDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/monetize/in-app-purchases-and-trials#store-ids).
