# Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchSuggestionCollection.AppendSearchSeparator

## -description

Appends a text label that is used to separate groups of suggestions in the search pane.

## -parameters

### -param label

The text to use as a separator. This text should be descriptive of any suggestions that are appended after it.

## -remarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To implement search in an app for Windows 10 or later, use [AutoSuggestBox](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox). See [Auto-suggest box](/windows/apps/design/controls/auto-suggest-box) for more info.
>
> You should not use [Windows.ApplicationModel.Search](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.search) APIs ([SearchPane](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.search.searchpane), `SearchContract`) or [SearchBox](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/searchbox.md) APIs in apps for Windows 10 or later.

The search pane can display 5 suggestions, at most. Additionally, each separator you use takes the place of a suggestion and decreases the number of suggestions that you can display.
