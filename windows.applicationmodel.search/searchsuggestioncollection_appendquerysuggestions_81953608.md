## -remarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To implement search in an app for Windows 10 or later, use [AutoSuggestBox](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox). See [Auto-suggest box](/windows/apps/design/controls/auto-suggest-box) for more info.
>
> You should not use [Windows.ApplicationModel.Search](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.search) APIs ([SearchPane](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.search.searchpane), `SearchContract`) or [SearchBox](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/searchbox.md) APIs in apps for Windows 10 or later.

A query suggestion is a suggestion that the user can select as his or her query.

The search pane can display 5 suggestions, at most. Additionally, each separator you use takes the place of a suggestion and lowers the number of suggestions that you can display.
