# Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchPane.QuerySubmitted

## -description
Fires when the user submits the text in the search box and the app needs to display search results.

## -remarks
> [!NOTE]
> An app can't use both the search box ([Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.SearchBox](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/searchbox.md) for UWP app using C++, C#, or Visual Basic, [WinJS.UI.SearchBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/dn301949(v=win.10)) for Windows app using JavaScript) and the [SearchPane](searchpane.md). Using both the search box and the search pane in the same app causes the app to throw an exception with this message: "Cannot create instance of type 'Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.SearchBox.'"

If your app participates in the Search contract, register an event handler to respond when this event fires. In your QuerySubmitted event handler, respond by taking the user to your search results page and populating it with results based on the [SearchPaneQuerySubmittedEventArgs](searchpanequerysubmittedeventargs.md).[QueryText](searchpanequerysubmittedeventargs_querytext.md).

## -examples
**For C#/C++/VB:** This example demonstrates how to ensure that your app can respond to user queries at any time by overriding [OnWindowCreated](../windows.ui.xaml/application_onwindowcreated_1983609380.md) in App.xaml.cs/App.xaml.cpp/App.xaml.vb to access the [SearchPane](searchpane.md) object and register handlers for [SearchPane](searchpane.md) events (like QuerySubmitted).

```csharp
protected override void OnWindowCreated(WindowCreatedEventArgs args)
{
    // At window creation time, access the SearchPane object and register SearchPane events
    // (like QuerySubmitted, SuggestionsRequested, and ResultSuggestionChosen) so that the app
    // can respond to the user's search queries at any time.

    // Get search pane
    Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchPane searchPane = SearchPane.GetForCurrentView();
    
    // Register event handlers for SearchPane events

    // Register QuerySubmitted event handler
    searchPane.QuerySubmitted += new TypedEventHandler<SearchPane, SearchPaneQuerySubmittedEventArgs>(OnQuerySubmitted);
    
    // Register a SuggestionsRequested if your app displays its own suggestions in the search pane (like from a web service)
    // Register a ResultSuggestionChosen if your app uses result suggestions in the search pane    
}
```

**For JavaScript:** This example demonstrates how to access the [searchPane](searchpane.md) to register a querysubmitted event handler.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that your app can respond to user queries at any time, make sure your [searchPane](searchpane.md) event handlers are registered in your app's global scope.

```javascript

// Register event handler for QuerySubmitted
Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchPane.getForCurrentView().onquerysubmitted = function (eventObject) {
    // Respond to query and perform search
};
```
