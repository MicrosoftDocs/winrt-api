<!-- Event syntax
public event Windows.Foundation.TypedEventHandler PushNotificationReceived<Windows.Networking.PushNotifications.PushNotificationChannel,  Windows.Networking.PushNotifications.PushNotificationReceivedEventArgs>
-->

# Windows.Networking.PushNotifications.PushNotificationChannel.PushNotificationReceived

## -description
Raised when a push notification arrives on this channel.

## -remarks
Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) sends this event only when the notification's target app is in the foreground. If the app is suspended, it does not receive the event.

## -examples
The following example shows a listener for this event, which invokes the event handler.

```javascript

function listeningForPushNotification() {
    if (channel) {
        channel.addEventListener("pushnotificationreceived", pushNotificationReceivedHandler);
}
```
