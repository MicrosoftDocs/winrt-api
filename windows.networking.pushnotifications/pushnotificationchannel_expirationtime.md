# Windows.Networking.PushNotifications.PushNotificationChannel.ExpirationTime

## -description
Gets the time at which the channel expires. Notifications sent to this channel after this time are rejected.

## -property-value
The time at which the channel expires. Notifications sent to this channel after this time are rejected.

## -remarks
To prevent a channel from expiring, apps should request a new push notification channel every time that the app is run.

An expired channel behaves as though it was closed. Because channels cannot be renewed, after a channel expires, a secondary tile or application must request a new push notification channel.
