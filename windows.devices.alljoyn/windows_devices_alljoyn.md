# Windows.Devices.AllJoyn

## -description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The types in the **Windows.Devices.AllJoyn** namespace are deprecated, and might not be available in future versions of Windows. [AllJoyn](https://openconnectivity.org/technology/reference-implementation/alljoyn/)&mdash;sponsored by AllSeen Alliance&mdash;was an open-source discovery and communication protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios such as turning lights on and off, and reading temperatures. For alternatives, such as [IoTivity Lite](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite) and [IoTivity](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity), refer to the [iotivity.org](https://iotivity.org/) website.

AllJoyn is an open source, cross-platform, DCOM-like framework, and protocol for making remotable method calls, remotely reading or writing properties, and sending one-way "signals" between applications (called "nodes") on a distributed bus. It is intended to be used primarily for Internet of Things scenarios such as turning on/off lights or reading temperatures.

The Windows.Devices.AllJoyn namespace allows apps to create endpoints on a distributed bus and do things like expose metadata or query another endpoint’s metadata.
