# Windows.Devices.AllJoyn

## -description

AllJoyn is an open source, cross-platform, DCOM-like framework, and protocol for making remotable method calls, remotely reading or writing properties, and sending one-way "signals" between applications (called "nodes") on a distributed bus. It is intended to be used primarily for Internet of Things scenarios such as turning on/off lights or reading temperatures.

The Windows.Devices.AllJoyn namespace allows apps to create endpoints on a distributed bus and do things like expose metadata or query another endpointâ€™s metadata.
