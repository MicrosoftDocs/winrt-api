# Windows.UI.Xaml.Data.CollectionViewSource.View

## -description
Gets the view object that is currently associated with this instance of [CollectionViewSource](collectionviewsource.md).

## -property-value
The view object that is currently associated with this instance of [CollectionViewSource](collectionviewsource.md).

## -remarks
This property is initialized when you set the [Source](collectionviewsource_source.md) property. At that time, a view is generated automatically unless the source collection implements [ICollectionViewFactory](icollectionviewfactory.md). Otherwise, the view is retrieved through the [CreateView](icollectionviewfactory_createview_164792513.md) method.
