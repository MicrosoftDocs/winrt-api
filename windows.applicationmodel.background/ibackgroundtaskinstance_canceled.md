# Windows.ApplicationModel.Background.IBackgroundTaskInstance.Canceled

## -description
Attaches a cancellation event handler to the background task instance.



> For Windows Phone 8.x app, if the device becomes low on memory, background tasks may be terminated without any warning and without raising the OnCanceled event. This helps to ensure the user experience of the app in the foreground. Your background task should be designed to handle this scenario. Note that this only applies to Windows Phone.
