# Windows.ApplicationModel.Background

## -description

Enables an app to schedule background tasks to run app code even when the app is suspended.

Background tasks are intended for small work items that do not require user interaction or for handling toast actions. Scenarios that are appropriate for background tasks include downloading mail, showing a toast notification for an incoming chat message, or reacting to a change in a system condition.

See [Supporting your app with background tasks ( using JavaScript and HTML)](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh977046(v=win.10)) or [Support your app with background tasks](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/support-your-app-with-background-tasks) for guidance on implementing background tasks. For example code that shows how to implement background tasks, see the [Background Task Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/BackgroundTask).
