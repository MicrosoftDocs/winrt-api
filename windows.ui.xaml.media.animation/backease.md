# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.BackEase

## -description
Represents an easing function that changes a value in the opposite direction of the main function during part of a duration, then reverses and finishes the function-over-time behavior in a conventional way.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<BackEase .../>
```


## -remarks
BackEase is one of the two easing functions that can produce a value outside of the normal **From**/**To** range. (The other is [ElasticEase](elasticease.md).)
+ If [EasingMode](easingmode.md) is **EaseIn** (the default) then the function starts by changing the value in the opposite direction of the value change that **From** and **To** indicate, in other words it initially produces a value that's less than the **From** value.
+ If [EasingMode](easingmode.md) is **EaseOut** then the function starts in a typical way, but near the end will exceed the **To** value and then come back to the **To** value at the end.
+ If [EasingMode](easingmode.md) is **EaseInOut** then the function gives values that are less than **From** at the beginning and greater than **To** near the end.
 This illustration shows a function-over-time graph approximation for a BackEase for each of the three possible [EasingMode](easingmode.md) values, with [Amplitude](backease_amplitude.md) as its default value.<img src="images/backease_concept.png" alt="Illustration of function-over-time graph for the BackEase easing function. The graph shows curves where the x axis is time t and the y axis is function-over-time f(t)" />

You might get best results by just experimenting with the [Springiness](elasticease_springiness.md) and [EasingMode](easingfunctionbase_easingmode.md) properties until the animation is visually doing what you want for your animated property value scenario.

An easing function can be applied to the **EasingFunction** properties of **From**/**To**/**By** animations, or to the **EasingFunction** properties of key-frame types used for the **Easing** variants of key-frame animations. For more info, see [Key-frame animations and easing function animations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/graphics/key-frame-and-easing-function-animations).

## -examples
The following example applies a BackEase easing function to a [DoubleAnimation](doubleanimation.md) to create an animation that retracts slightly at the beginning and end of the animation.
