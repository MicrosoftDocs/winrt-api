# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.Storyboard

## -description
Controls animations with a timeline, and provides object and property targeting information for its child animations.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<Storyboard ...>
  oneOrMoreChildTimelines
</Storyboard>
```


## -remarks
Storyboard is an important class in the concept of *storyboarded animations*. For more info on the concept, see [Storyboarded animations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/graphics/storyboarded-animations).

Storyboard is used for these properties:
+ [VisualState.Storyboard](../windows.ui.xaml/visualstate_storyboard.md)
+ [VisualTransition.Storyboard](../windows.ui.xaml/visualtransition_storyboard.md)
+ [BeginStoryboard.Storyboard](beginstoryboard_storyboard_1221375020.md)


These properties aren't the only place where a Storyboard is defined. The typical way that a Storyboard is used for a storyboarded animation is that the Storyboard is defined in a **Resources** collection (either [Application.Resources](../windows.ui.xaml/application_resources.md) or [FrameworkElement.Resources](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_resources.md), or possibly as a resource within a file such as Generic.xaml for a custom control). Whenever it's defined as a XAML resource, you should always assign an [x:Name attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/x-name-attribute) value to your Storyboard. You can then reference the name as a programming variable later in code-behind. You'll need this reference to actually run the animations that the Storyboard contains, by calling the [Begin](storyboard_begin_1621727531.md) method on that Storyboard instance. Storyboard also has other control methods such as [Stop](storyboard_stop_1201535524.md) that can control the animation thereafter.

Storyboard inherits several properties from [Timeline](timeline.md). These properties can be applied either to a Storyboard or to one of the animations within it (in the [Children](storyboard_children.md) collection). There are pros and cons to setting [Timeline](timeline.md) properties on the main Storyboard instead of on each animation. For more info, see [Storyboarded animations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/graphics/storyboarded-animations).

You also need a Storyboard in order to control the predefined animations that you add to controls or UI, if you are using one of the theme animations. Theme animations don't have an innate trigger point, so you need to contain theme animations in a Storyboard as the [Children](storyboard_children.md). If the Storyboard is used as the [VisualState.Storyboard](../windows.ui.xaml/visualstate_storyboard.md) value then the animation runs when that visual state is loaded. Or, if it's in a [VisualTransition.Storyboard](../windows.ui.xaml/visualtransition_storyboard.md), the animation runs when that transition is detected by the visual state manager. These are the most common way to use a theme animation, but you could also put one in a loose Storyboard resource and explicitly start the animation by calling [Begin](storyboard_begin_1621727531.md). For more info on how to use theme animations, see [Quickstart: Animating your UI using library animations](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh452703(v=win.10)) or [Storyboarded animations for visual states](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/jj819808(v=win.10)).

### XAML attached properties

Storyboard is the host service class for several [XAML attached properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/attached-properties-overview). These enable child animations under control by the Storyboard to each target separate target elements and target properties, while still following the same controlling timeline and triggering mechanism as the parent.

In order to support XAML processor access to the attached properties, and also to expose equivalent _get_ and _set_ operations to code, each XAML attached property has a pair of Get and Set accessor methods. Another way to get or set the value in code is to use the dependency property system, calling either [GetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_getvalue_1188551207.md) or [SetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_setvalue_52578133.md) and passing the identifier field as the dependency property identifier.

| Attached property | Description |
| - | - |
| TargetName | Gets or sets the name of the object to animate.<ul><li>Type: string</li><li>Identifier field: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard.targetnameproperty">TargetNameProperty</a></li><li>Accessor methods: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard.gettargetname">GetTargetName</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard.settargetname">SetTargetName</a></li></ul> Storyboard.TargetName is used to reference another element by its name. The element being referenced is the element/object where the animation should apply. This mechanism is part of the basic design of the animation system: it enables animation resources to be declared separately from UI declaration resources, and makes it possible to apply one animation definition to several different property behaviors. For the value of Storyboard.TargetName on a particular animation, you specify the target element's [Name](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_name.md) or [x:Name attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/x-name-attribute) value, which is a string. That named element should already exist in some other area of XAML markup.<br/>The meaning of [Name](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_name.md)/[x:Name attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/x-name-attribute) strings is controlled by a XAML namescope concept. For most animation targeting scenarios you won't need to worry about the influence of XAML namescopes, but you might encounter XAML name resolution issues if you're trying to target template parts, or objects that were created using [XamlReader.Load](../windows.ui.xaml.markup/xamlreader_load_1077941801.md) and subsequently added to the object tree. For more info, see [XAML namescopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-namescopes).|
| TargetProperty | Gets or sets the property that should be animated.<ul><li>Type: string</li><li>Identifier field: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard.targetpropertyproperty">TargetPropertyProperty</a></li><li>Accessor methods: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard.gettargetproperty">GetTargetProperty</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard.settargetproperty">SetTargetProperty</a></li></ul>Storyboard.TargetProperty targets a particular property of the element specified by Storyboard.TargetName. The value you provide for Storyboard.TargetProperty involves a concept known as a *property path*. For more information on how to specify a property path for an animation, see Remarks in [SetTargetProperty](storyboard_settargetproperty_865303802.md) or [Storyboard.TargetProperty](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard#xaml-attached-properties), or the [Property-path syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/property-path-syntax) topic. |

## -examples
The following example shows how to use the [Begin](storyboard_begin_1621727531.md), [Stop](storyboard_stop_1201535524.md), [Pause](storyboard_pause_1953642114.md), and [Resume](storyboard_resume_406343050.md) methods to control the playback of a storyboard (animation). A set of buttons allow the user to call these methods.
