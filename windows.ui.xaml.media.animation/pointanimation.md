# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.PointAnimation

## -description
Animates the value of a [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) property between two target values using linear interpolation over a specified [Duration](timeline_duration.md).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<PointAnimation .../>
```


## -remarks
Use [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md) to animate the property value of any dependency property that is of type [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md).

Linear interpolation for a [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) means that **X** and **Y** values are treated as a number and the interpolation is simply a mathematical operation.

Sometimes you'll need to use indirect property targeting in order to target a sub-property of another object that's the value of a property on the target. For example, in order to animate parts of a [PathGeometry](../windows.ui.xaml.media/pathgeometry.md), you need to reference some of the intermediate object-property values, until the last step in the indirect property path is truly a [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) value. For more info on indirect property targeting and other storyboarded animation concepts, see [Storyboarded animations](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0cbceea0-2b0e-44a1-a09a-f7a939632f3a) or [Property-path syntax](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff3ecf47-d81f-46e3-be01-c839e0398025).

A [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md) typically has at least one of the [From](pointanimation_from.md), [By](pointanimation_by.md) or [To](pointanimation_to.md) properties set, but never all three.
+ **From only:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the **From** property to the base value of the property being animated.
+ **From and To:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the **From** property to the value specified by the **To** property.
+ **From and By:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the **From** property to the value specified by the sum of the **From** and **By** properties.
+ **To only:** The animation progresses from the animated property's base value or a previous animation's output value to the value specified by the **To** property.
+ **By only:** The animation progresses from the base value of the property being animated or a previous animation's output value to the sum of that value and the value specified by the **By** property.


The [From](pointanimation_from.md), [By](pointanimation_by.md) or [To](pointanimation_to.md) properties of a [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md) aren't a [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) value. Instead these are a [Nullable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1) for [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md). The default value for these is **null**, not an uninitialized structure. That **null** value is how the animation system distinguishes that you haven't specifically set a value. VisualÂ C++ component extensions (C++/CX) doesn't have a [Nullable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1) type, so it uses [IReference](../windows.foundation/ireference_1.md) instead.

## -examples
The following example shows how to use the [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md) to animate the [Center](../windows.ui.xaml.media/ellipsegeometry_center.md) property of an [EllipseGeometry](../windows.ui.xaml.media/ellipsegeometry.md).
