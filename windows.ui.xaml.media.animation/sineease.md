# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.SineEase

## -description
Represents an easing function that creates an animation that accelerates and/or decelerates using a sine formula.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<SineEase .../>
```


## -remarks
SineEase is an easing function that has a function-over-time formula that resembles a sine curve when represented as a function-time graph. When [EasingMode](easingfunctionbase_easingmode.md) is **EaseIn** (the default), this easing function starts slow and accelerates gradually as it reaches the end. It reaches about 30% value halfway through the duration.

The formula used for this function is:

An easing function can be applied to the **EasingFunction** properties of **From**/**To**/**By** animations, or to the **EasingFunction** properties of key-frame types used for the **Easing** variants of key-frame animations. For more info, see [Key-frame animations and easing function animations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/graphics/key-frame-and-easing-function-animations).

## -examples
This XAML example applies a SineEase easing function to a [DoubleAnimation](doubleanimation.md) to create a decelerating animation.
