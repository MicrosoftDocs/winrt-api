# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation

## -description
Animates the value of a [Color](../windows.ui/color.md) property between two target values using linear interpolation over a specified [Duration](timeline_duration.md).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<ColorAnimation .../>
```


## -remarks
Use [ColorAnimation](coloranimation.md) to animate the property value of any dependency property that is of type [Color](../windows.ui/color.md).

Linear interpolation for a [Color](../windows.ui/color.md) means that each of the **ARGB** values is treated as a byte and the interpolation is simply a mathematical operation. You get best results from color interpolation if at least one of the **RGB** components is the same or close to the same in both the starting value and ending value.

You usually need to use indirect property targeting in order to target a sub-property of another object that's the value of a property on the target. This is because very few properties that display color information in UI elements are actually of type [Color](../windows.ui/color.md). Most are instead of type [Brush](../windows.ui.xaml.media/brush.md). To use [ColorAnimation](coloranimation.md) on UI elements, you typically are targeting the [Color](../windows.ui.xaml.media/solidcolorbrush_color.md) property of a [SolidColorBrush](../windows.ui.xaml.media/solidcolorbrush.md) that's the sub-property value. Syntax for this is shown in the XAML example in the "Examples" section. For more info on indirect property targeting and other storyboarded animation concepts, see [Storyboarded animations](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0cbceea0-2b0e-44a1-a09a-f7a939632f3a) or [Property-path syntax](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff3ecf47-d81f-46e3-be01-c839e0398025).

A [ColorAnimation](coloranimation.md) typically has at least one of the [From](coloranimation_from.md), [By](coloranimation_by.md) or [To](coloranimation_to.md) properties set, but never all three.
+ **From only:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the [From](coloranimation_from.md) property to the base value of the property being animated.
+ **From and To:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the [From](coloranimation_from.md) property to the value specified by the [To](coloranimation_to.md) property.
+ **From and By:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the [From](coloranimation_from.md) property to the value specified by the sum of the [From](coloranimation_from.md) and [By](coloranimation_by.md) properties.
+ **To only:** The animation progresses from the animated property's base value or a previous animation's output value to the value specified by the [To](coloranimation_to.md) property.
+ **By only:** The animation progresses from the base value of the property being animated or a previous animation's output value to the sum of that value and the value specified by the [By](coloranimation_by.md) property.


The [From](coloranimation_from.md), [By](coloranimation_by.md) and [To](coloranimation_to.md) properties of a [ColorAnimation](coloranimation.md) aren't strictly a [Color](../windows.ui/color.md). Instead these are a [Nullable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1) for [Color](../windows.ui/color.md). The default value for these is **null**, not an uninitialized structure. That **null** value is how the animation system distinguishes that you haven't specifically set a value. Visual C++ component extensions (C++/CX) doesn't have a [Nullable](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1) type, so it uses [IReference](../windows.foundation/ireference_1.md) instead.

## -examples
The following example shows how to use [ColorAnimation](coloranimation.md) to animate the background color of a [StackPanel](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/stackpanel.md).

```xaml
Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Panel.Background).(SolidColorBrush.Color)"
```

Alternatively, you could explicitly create the [SolidColorBrush](../windows.ui.xaml.media/solidcolorbrush.md), name it, and target its [Color](../windows.ui.xaml.media/solidcolorbrush_color.md) property directly. The example below shows how to create the same animation as the previous one except it uses direct property targeting.
