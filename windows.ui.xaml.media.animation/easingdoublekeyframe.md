# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.EasingDoubleKeyFrame

## -description
Associates an easing function with a [DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames](doubleanimationusingkeyframes.md) key-frame animation.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<EasingDoubleKeyFrame .../>
```


## -remarks
Easing functions allow you to apply custom mathematical formulas to your animations. Mathematical operations are often useful to produce animations that simulate real-world physics in a 2-D coordinate system. For example, you may want an object to realistically bounce or behave as though it were on a spring. For a list of easing functions and info on how to use them, see [Key-frame animations and easing function animations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/graphics/key-frame-and-easing-function-animations).

If no easing function is set, the default easing function will be linear. 

## -examples
This XAML example shows how to use key frames that have easing functions associated with them to create an animation of a rectangle that contracts upward, slows down, then expands downward (as though falling), and then bounces to a stop.
