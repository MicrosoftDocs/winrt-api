# Windows.Devices.Lights.Effects.LampArrayColorRampEffect

## -description
Transitions lamp/s from their existing color (whatever last set to), to the prescribed color.

## -remarks
Transition is via a simple linear curve over the prescribed [RampDuration](lamparraycolorrampeffect_rampduration.md).

Behavior across lamps is not guaranteed to be identical as lamp/s can start from different colors.

Before you can play an effect, you must append it to a **LampArrayEffectPlaylist** (see [Append](lamparrayeffectplaylist_append_292269384.md)).

If a [LampArray](../windows.devices.lights/lamparray.md) is bound to a LampArrayColorRampEffect and it disconnects, progress of the effect continues as a no-op. No exception/error is thrown/returned.
