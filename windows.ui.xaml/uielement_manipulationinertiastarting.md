# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.ManipulationInertiaStarting

## -description

Occurs when the input device loses contact with the [UIElement](uielement.md) object during a manipulation and inertia begins.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement ManipulationInertiaStarting="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

For custom controls and interaction experiences, see [GestureRecognizer.ManipulationInertiaStarting](../windows.ui.input/gesturerecognizer_manipulationinertiastarting.md).

An element must have a [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) value other than **None** or **System** to be a manipulation event source. The default value of [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) is **System**, which enables built-in control logic to process manipulations, but doesn't permit app code to handle manipulation events. If you want to handle manipulations, set [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) to **All**, or to specific [ManipulationModes](../windows.ui.xaml.input/manipulationmodes.md) values. For more info, see [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md).

ManipulationInertiaStarting is a routed event. If the event is permitted to bubble up to parent elements because it goes unhandled, then it is possible to handle the event on parent elements even if [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) is **None** or **System** on the parent element. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

For touch actions and also for interaction-specific or manipulation events that are consequences of a touch action, an element must be hit-test visible in order to be the event source and fire the event that is associated with the action. [UIElement.Visibility](uielement_visibility.md) must be [Visible](visibility.md). Other properties of derived types also affect hit-test visibility. For more info, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

ManipulationInertiaStarting supports the ability to attach event handlers to the route that will be invoked even if the event data for the event is marked [Handled](../windows.ui.xaml.input/manipulationinertiastartingroutedeventargs_handled.md). See [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_2121467075.md).

### Windows 8 behavior

Windows 8 doesn't fire [ManipulationCompleted](uielement_manipulationcompleted.md) in cases where the inertial phase has started (and ManipulationInertiaStarting has fired) but the user has tapped on the item before it's finished scrolling, which cancels the inertial phase visually. The issue is fixed starting with Windows 8.1; [ManipulationCompleted](uielement_manipulationcompleted.md) is fired as soon as the tap action cancels the inertial phase.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 continue to use the Windows 8 behavior.
