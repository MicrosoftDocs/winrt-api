# Windows.UI.Xaml.PointHelper

## -description

Provides helper methods to set [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code should use methods of [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) instead.

## -remarks

 [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) is a Windows Runtime structure that represents an **X**,**Y** position in a coordinate system. A [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) is used as a value in many different Windows Runtime APIs.

PointHelper is one of several **Helper** classes that are intended to provide utility methods for Windows Runtime structure values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code can use members of [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) instead, because utility members are available directly on the structure due to .NET Framework runtime support. C++ code can only access the **X** and **Y** data values on [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md). For C++ developers, approximately the same utility features that a Microsoft Visual Basic developer could use directly on [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md) are available in a static form on the PointHelper class.
