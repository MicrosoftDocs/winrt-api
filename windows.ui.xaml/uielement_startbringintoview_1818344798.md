# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.StartBringIntoView


## -description

Initiates a request to the XAML framework to bring the element into view within any scrollable regions it is contained within.

## -remarks

The request is fulfilled asynchronously as the framework initiates changes to the view of [ScrollViewer](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/scrollviewer.md)s that contain the element.  The [HorizontalOffset](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/scrollviewer_horizontaloffset.md) and [VerticalOffset](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/scrollviewer_verticaloffset.md) of those ScrollViewers may not be updated immediately upon returning from the call.  However, in the process of servicing the request a ScrollViewerâ€™s [ViewChanging](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.scrollviewer_viewchanging.md) and [ViewChanged](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.scrollviewer_viewchanged.md) events will fire.
If you use the signature that does not specify any options, then the entire element size (its [RenderSize](uielement_rendersize.md)) will be made visible and any changes to the viewports will be animated.
The StartBringIntoView method does not transmit any information about success or failure.  Reasons for failure can include the element settings, such as [Visibility](uielement_visibility.md) being some value other than **Visible**.
