# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.ManipulationCompleted

## -description

Occurs when a manipulation on the [UIElement](uielement.md) is complete.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement ManipulationCompleted="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

For custom controls and interaction experiences, see [GestureRecognizer.ManipulationCompleted](../windows.ui.input/gesturerecognizer_manipulationcompleted.md).

An element must have a [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) value other than **None** or **System** to be a manipulation event source. The default value of [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) is **System**, which enables built-in control logic to process manipulations, but doesn't permit app code to handle manipulation events. If you want to handle manipulations, set [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) to **All**, or to specific [ManipulationModes](../windows.ui.xaml.input/manipulationmodes.md) values. For more info, see [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md).

ManipulationCompleted is a routed event. If the event is permitted to bubble up to parent elements because it goes unhandled, then it is possible to handle the event on parent elements even if [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) is **None** or **System** on the parent element. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

For touch actions and also for interaction-specific or manipulation events that are consequences of a touch action, an element must be hit-test visible in order to be the event source and fire the event that is associated with the action. [UIElement.Visibility](uielement_visibility.md) must be [Visible](visibility.md). Other properties of derived types also affect hit-test visibility. For more info, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

ManipulationCompleted supports the ability to attach event handlers to the route that will be invoked even if the event data for the event is marked [Handled](../windows.ui.xaml.input/manipulationcompletedroutedeventargs_handled.md). See [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_2121467075.md).

### Windows 8 behavior

Windows 8 doesn't fire ManipulationCompleted in cases where the inertial phase has started (and [ManipulationInertiaStarting](uielement_manipulationinertiastarting.md) has fired) but the user has tapped on the item before it's finished scrolling, which cancels the inertial phase visually. The issue is fixed starting with Windows 8.1; ManipulationCompleted is fired as soon as the tap action cancels the inertial phase.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 continue to use the Windows 8 behavior.
