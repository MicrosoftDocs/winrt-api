# Windows.UI.Xaml.BringIntoViewOptions.TargetRect

## -description
Gets or sets the area of an element to bring into view.



## -property-value
A rectangle that defines the area of an element to bring into view.

## -remarks
Set the TargetRect to specify a particular part of an element to be brought into view. For example, if you need to scroll a large image into view, you could define a specific part of the image that should be made visible. If the TargetRect is **null**, the element's bounding rect is used as the target.
