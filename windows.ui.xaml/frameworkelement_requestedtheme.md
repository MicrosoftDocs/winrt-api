# Windows.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement.RequestedTheme

## -description
Gets or sets the UI theme that is used by the [UIElement](uielement.md) (and its child elements) for resource determination. The UI theme you specify with RequestedTheme can override the app-level [RequestedTheme](application_requestedtheme.md).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<uiElement RequestedTheme="elementThemeMemberName" .../>
```


## -property-value
A value of the enumeration, for example **Light**.

## -remarks
Changing the RequestedTheme value is effectively changing the resource lookup behavior for the element's default template. If you change the value to **Light** then the template uses the values from the [ResourceDictionary](resourcedictionary.md) that is keyed as "Light" in the [ThemeDictionaries](resourcedictionary_themedictionaries.md) collection. Setting the UI theme differently from the app's theme is often appropriate for floating controls such as menus and flyouts.

You can change the value of the RequestedTheme property for any given element at run-time. That's in contrast to the [Application.RequestedTheme](application_requestedtheme.md) property, which throws an exception if you try to set it while the app's running.

The RequestedTheme value you set on a [FrameworkElement](frameworkelement.md) will inherit to any elements that are nested within the element where RequestedTheme is set, but that inheritance can be overridden by explicitly setting RequestedTheme again. For example, in this XAML example, the parent [StackPanel](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/stackpanel.md) sets the theme to **Light**, and that value inherits to the first [TextBlock](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/textblock.md) child element, but not to the second [TextBlock](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/textblock.md) because it's setting the value to **Dark** instead.
```xaml
<StackPanel RequestedTheme="Light">
  <TextBlock>Text using light theme.</TextBlock>
  <TextBlock RequestedTheme="Dark">Text using dark theme.</TextBlock>
</StackPanel>
```



The RequestedTheme property is ignored if the user is running in high contrast mode. See [High-contrast themes](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/accessibility/high-contrast-themes) and [XAML high contrast style sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Windows%208.1%20Store%20app%20samples/99866-Windows%208.1%20Store%20app%20samples/XAML%20high%20contrast%20style%20sample).



> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, setting RequestedTheme to [ElementTheme.Default](elementtheme.md) will always result in "Dark" being the theme. On Windows Phone, using the [ElementTheme.Default](elementtheme.md) value will result in a query for the system theme, as set by the user.
