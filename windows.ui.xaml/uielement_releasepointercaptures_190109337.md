# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.ReleasePointerCaptures

## -description

Releases all pointer captures held by this element.

## -remarks

Because there are input scenarios such as manipulations that involve more than one pointer point, the Windows Runtime enables capturing more than one pointer at a time. Calling [ReleasePointerCapture](uielement_releasepointercapture_962192786.md) removes a specific [Pointer](../windows.ui.xaml.input/pointer.md) from the collection as identified by its ID, whereas ReleasePointerCaptures clears the entire collection.

User action that invalidates pointer capture such as releasing from a pointer point also changes capture state. For more info, see [Mouse interactions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/mouse-interactions) and [Handle pointer input](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/handle-pointer-input).

The [PointerCaptures](uielement_pointercaptures.md) property exposes a view of which pointer points are currently captured by the [UIElement](uielement.md).
