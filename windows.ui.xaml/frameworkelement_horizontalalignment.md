# Windows.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment

## -description
Gets or sets the horizontal alignment characteristics that are applied to a [FrameworkElement](frameworkelement.md) when it is composed in a layout parent, such as a panel or items control.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<frameworkElement HorizontalAlignment="horizontalAlignmentMemberName"/>
 

```


## -xaml-values
<dl><dt>horizontalAlignmentMemberName</dt><dd>horizontalAlignmentMemberNameA constant name from the HorizontalAlignment enumeration, for example Left.</dd>
</dl>
## -property-value
A horizontal alignment setting, as a value of the enumeration. The default is **Stretch**.

## -remarks
Alignment properties are intended to hint the desired layout to an adaptive layout container. They're typically set on [FrameworkElement](frameworkelement.md) children and interpreted by another [FrameworkElement](frameworkelement.md) container parent (typically a [ContentControl](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/contentcontrol.md) derived class or a [Panel](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/panel.md) derived class, or perhaps a presenter). Setting alignment properties on a child element is no guarantee that anything happens; the behavior depends on the layout composition and the parent elements involved.

When the [Height](frameworkelement_height.md) and [Width](frameworkelement_width.md) properties are explicitly set or calculated on an object, those measurements are more important to typical layout logic, and can cancel the effects of setting HorizontalAlignment to [Stretch](horizontalalignment.md). Layout constraint properties (such as [MaxWidth](frameworkelement_maxwidth.md)) also affect the maximum or minimum layout size for a **Stretch** layout situation. **Stretch** is the default so that it's easier to use adaptive layout techniques in the cases where there is no explicit measurement. But if there are either [Height](frameworkelement_height.md) and [Width](frameworkelement_width.md) or clipping, the layout acts as if the value is **Top** for [VerticalAlignment](frameworkelement_verticalalignment.md), typically **Left** for HorizontalAlignment (**Right** for right-to-left culture info or explicit [FlowDirection](frameworkelement_flowdirection.md) values). For more info, see [Alignment, margin, and padding](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/layout/alignment-margin-padding).

[Canvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/canvas.md) does not use HorizontalAlignment when composing layout, because [Canvas](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/canvas.md) is based on absolute positioning. In general, the value of HorizontalAlignment is potentially treated differently by any object that is capable of having one or more [FrameworkElement](frameworkelement.md) objects as child content. Each such parent object can have its own layout logic.

Each XAML UI element might apply this property differently based on the [Style](style.md) setters for the implicit style. The apparent "default value" for HorizontalAlignment in each UI element can be different. For example, a [Button](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/button.md) control starts with the value **Left**. If the UI element is a control, the HorizontalAlignment value might also affect the control's visual template.

In content controls, the control template often uses [{TemplateBinding} markup extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/templatebinding-markup-extension) expressions to bind the [HorizontalContentAlignment](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/control_horizontalcontentalignment.md) property to a HorizontalAlignment property on some element within its template, such as the presenter or the element used as the content area.

## -examples
In this example, the value **Center** is assigned to HorizontalAlignment and [VerticalAlignment](frameworkelement_verticalalignment.md), to position the [TextBlock](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/textblock.md) elements in the center of the [Grid](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/grid.md) cells.
