# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.DoubleTapped

## -description

Occurs when an otherwise unhandled **DoubleTap** interaction occurs over the hit test area of this element.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement DoubleTapped="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

A **DoubleTap** interaction is simply two **Tap** interactions that occur in quick succession. The exact timing of what the system interprets as a double tap is adjustable by users through system settings.

See [Touch interaction design](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9ba7f613-e5d1-40d4-920b-143094209e3a) for more info on how to use a **DoubleTap** interaction in your app design.

If a user interaction also fires DoubleTapped, [Tapped](uielement_tapped.md) will fire first to represent the first tap, but the second tap won't fire an additional Tapped. If you want different logic for [Tapped](uielement_tapped.md) versus DoubleTapped, your [Tapped](uielement_tapped.md) handler may need to use app-specific variables and a timer in order to avoid running on interactions that are eventually interpreted as a **DoubleTap** action.

A DoubleTapped event represents a gesture, whereas a [PointerPressed](uielement_pointerpressed.md) event is a lower-level input event. DoubleTapped and [PointerPressed](uielement_pointerpressed.md) events can fire as the result of a single user interaction. Even if a control is already handling pointer events in the control logic, or is handling manipulations, that doesn't prevent DoubleTapped from firing.

A DoubleTapped event is potentially the result of more than one pointer point. For the higher-level gesture events like DoubleTapped you no longer have immediate access to [PointerPoint](../windows.ui.input/pointerpoint.md) details such as individual [PointerId](../windows.ui.input/pointerpoint_pointerid.md) values or individual coordinates. You do have access to device type ([PointerDeviceType](../windows.ui.xaml.input/doubletappedroutedeventargs_pointerdevicetype.md)) and for coordinates you can call [GetPosition](../windows.ui.xaml.input/doubletappedroutedeventargs_getposition_1813281865.md), which gives an average of the coordinates for a **DoubleTap** from more than one pointer point.

DoubleTapped is a routed event. Also, an element must have [IsDoubleTapEnabled](uielement_isdoubletapenabled.md) be **true** to be a DoubleTapped event source (**true** is the default). It is possible to handle DoubleTapped on parent elements even if [IsDoubleTapEnabled](uielement_isdoubletapenabled.md) is **false** on the parent element, if the event bubbles to a parent from an event source child element where [IsDoubleTapEnabled](uielement_isdoubletapenabled.md) is **false**. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

For touch actions and also for interaction-specific or manipulation events that are consequences of a touch action, an element must be hit-test visible in order to be the event source and fire the event that is associated with the action. [UIElement.Visibility](uielement_visibility.md) must be [Visible](visibility.md). Other properties of derived types also affect hit-test visibility. For more info, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

DoubleTapped supports the ability to attach event handlers to the route that will be invoked even if the event data for the event is marked **Handled**. See [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_2121467075.md).

Specific Windows Runtime controls may have class-based handling for the DoubleTapped input event. If so, the control probably has an override for the method [OnDoubleTapped](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/control_ondoubletapped_1132552853.md). Typically the event is marked handled by the class handler, and the DoubleTapped event is not raised for handling by any user code handlers on that control. For more info on how class-based handling for events works, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).
