# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.Holding

## -description

Occurs when an otherwise unhandled **Hold** interaction occurs over the hit test area of this element.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement Holding="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

Touch can produce a **Holding** action, but mouse devices generally can't. For more info, see [Handle pointer input](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/handle-pointer-input).

The [Tapped](uielement_tapped.md), [DoubleTapped](uielement_doubletapped.md), and [RightTapped](uielement_righttapped.md) events occur only after the touch point is removed. But the initial [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event occurs while the touch point is still in contact. The event occurs if the touch point remains in approximately the same [PointerPoint](../windows.ui.input/pointerpoint.md) position for a period of time. The exact timing of what the system interprets as a holding action is adjustable by users through system settings.

[Holding](uielement_holding.md) is intended for informational UI, but for interactions like displaying a context menu you should use [RightTapped](uielement_righttapped.md) instead. You might handle [Holding](uielement_holding.md) first to display a hint that a menu will appear, but to display the menu itself, use a [RightTapped](uielement_righttapped.md) handler. See [Touch interaction design](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9ba7f613-e5d1-40d4-920b-143094209e3a) or [UX guidelines for custom user interactions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/52f9607d-e2d0-44e4-9e1c-f856f7072a1e) for more info on how to use a **Hold** interaction in your app design.

[Holding](uielement_holding.md) events generally occur in pairs. When the action is first interpreted as a **Hold** action based on no movement for a period of time, [Holding](uielement_holding.md) fires, with [HoldingState](../windows.ui.input/holdingeventargs_holdingstate.md) value of **Started** in the [HoldingRoutedEventArgs](../windows.ui.xaml.input/holdingroutedeventargs.md) event data. When the **Hold** action ends, another [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event fires, this time with [HoldingState](../windows.ui.input/holdingeventargs_holdingstate.md) of either **Completed** or **Canceled**.

+ The **Hold** action ends with [HoldingState](../windows.ui.input/holdingeventargs_holdingstate.md) as **Completed** if the user doesn't move the pointer during the **Hold** state and then releases the pointer points that initiated the action. For this case, [RightTapped](uielement_righttapped.md) fires just after the second [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event.

+ The **Hold** action ends with [HoldingState](../windows.ui.input/holdingeventargs_holdingstate.md) as **Canceled** if the user does move the pointer(s) that initiated the action, or also for uncommon situations such as changing the hit-test status on the element during the action or capturing another pointer. If the **Hold** action ends with [HoldingState](../windows.ui.input/holdingeventargs_holdingstate.md) as **Canceled**, [RightTapped](uielement_righttapped.md) won't fire.

A [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event represents a gesture, whereas a [PointerPressed](uielement_pointerpressed.md) event is a lower-level input event. [Holding](uielement_holding.md) and [PointerPressed](uielement_pointerpressed.md) events can fire as the result of a single user interaction. Even if a control is already handling pointer events in the control logic, or is handling manipulations, that doesn't prevent [Holding](uielement_holding.md) from firing.

A [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event is potentially the result of more than one pointer point. For the higher-level gesture events like [Holding](uielement_holding.md) you no longer have immediate access to [PointerPoint](../windows.ui.input/pointerpoint.md) details such as individual [PointerId](../windows.ui.input/pointerpoint_pointerid.md) values or individual coordinates. You do have access to device type ([PointerDeviceType](../windows.ui.xaml.input/holdingroutedeventargs_pointerdevicetype.md)) and for coordinates you can call [GetPosition](../windows.ui.xaml.input/holdingroutedeventargs_getposition_1813281865.md), which gives an average of the coordinates for a **Hold** from more than one pointer point.

[Holding](uielement_holding.md) is a routed event. Also, an element must have [IsHoldingEnabled](uielement_isholdingenabled.md) be **true** to be a [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event source (**true** is the default). It is possible to handle [Holding](uielement_holding.md) on parent elements even if [IsHoldingEnabled](uielement_isholdingenabled.md) is **false** on the parent element, if the event bubbles to a parent from an event source child element where [IsHoldingEnabled](uielement_isholdingenabled.md) is **false**. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34c219e8-3efb-45bc-8bbd-6fd937698832).

For touch actions and also for interaction-specific or manipulation events that are consequences of a touch action, an element must be hit-test visible in order to be the event source and fire the event that is associated with the action. [UIElement.Visibility](uielement_visibility.md) must be [Visible](visibility.md). Other properties of derived types also affect hit-test visibility. For more info, see [Events and routed events overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34c219e8-3efb-45bc-8bbd-6fd937698832).

[Holding](uielement_holding.md) supports the ability to attach event handlers to the route that will be invoked even if the event data for the event is marked [Handled](../windows.ui.xaml.input/holdingroutedeventargs_handled.md). See [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_2121467075.md).

Specific Windows Runtime controls may have class-based handling for the [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event. If so, the control probably has an override for the method [OnHolding](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/control_onholding_1052914744.md). For more info on how class-based handling for events works, see [Events and routed events overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34c219e8-3efb-45bc-8bbd-6fd937698832).

[Tapped](uielement_tapped.md) and [Holding](uielement_holding.md) are mutually exclusive. If the action passes the time threshold to be considered a **Hold** action, it's not considered to be a **Tap** action also.

Whenever [Holding](uielement_holding.md) fires initially, so long as the element supports manipulation events through a non-default [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) value, [ManipulationStarting](uielement_manipulationstarting.md) fires too. If the pointer point remains in one place long enough for [Holding](uielement_holding.md) to be detected, but thereafter the user moves the pointer points associated with the **Hold** action without releasing them (leading to another [Holding](uielement_holding.md) event with [HoldingState](../windows.ui.input/holdingeventargs_holdingstate.md) as **Canceled**), then other manipulation events like [ManipulationStarted](uielement_manipulationstarted.md) and [ManipulationDelta](uielement_manipulationdelta.md) can fire also.

### Holding for mouse and pen/stylus input

Mouse input doesn't produce [Holding](uielement_holding.md) events by default, no matter how long a mouse button is held down, or which button is held. However, mouse devices and some pen devices can fire [RightTapped](uielement_righttapped.md) when a right mouse button or equivalent is pressed and released.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a way to treat mouse actions as hold actions if you use your own [GestureRecognizer](../windows.ui.input/gesturerecognizer.md) and specify **HoldWithMouse** in settings.
