# Windows.UI.Xaml.GridLengthHelper

## -description

Provides helper methods to evaluate or set [GridLength](gridlength.md) values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code should use methods of [GridLength](gridlength.md) instead.



## -remarks

[GridLength](gridlength.md) is a Windows Runtime structure that represents a factor for available-space measurements in rows or columns of a [Grid](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/grid.md).

GridLengthHelper is one of several **Helper** classes that are intended to provide utility methods for Windows Runtime structure values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code can use members of GridLength instead, because utility members are available directly on the structure due to .NET Framework runtime support. C++ code can only access the **Value** data value on GridLength. For C++ developers, approximately the same utility features that a Microsoft Visual Basic developer could use directly on GridLength are available in a static form on the GridLengthHelper class.
