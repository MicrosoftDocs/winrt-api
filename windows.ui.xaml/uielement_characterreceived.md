# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.CharacterReceived

## -description

Occurs when a single, composed character is received by the input queue.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement CharacterReceived="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> A composed character is a single visual object derived from a sequence of one or more other characters.

[CharacterReceived](uielement_characterreceived.md) is a routed event. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34c219e8-3efb-45bc-8bbd-6fd937698832).

Apps do not receive this event when an [Input Method Editor (IME)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/5fcc73e6-f499-47e6-8e81-0014ca4d241c) is enabled. The Input Method Editor (IME) handles all keyboard input and sets [Handled](../windows.ui.xaml.input/characterreceivedroutedeventargs_handled.md) to true.

This event is useful for text input scenarios such as "typeahead find or search" (also known as incremental search, incremental find, or real-time suggestions) where, as the user types, the control progressively searches for and filters text based on the characters in the input queue.

The [CharacterReceived](uielement_characterreceived.md) event can occur at different times depending on the character entered, as the event is not fired until the composed character is registered in the input queue.
