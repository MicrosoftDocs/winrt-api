# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.ManipulationStarting

## -description

Occurs when the manipulation processor is first created.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement ManipulationStarting="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

For custom controls and interaction experiences, see [GestureRecognizer](../windows.ui.input/gesturerecognizer.md).

An element must have a [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) value other than **None** or **System** to be a manipulation event source. The default value of [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) is **System**, which enables built-in control logic to process manipulations, but doesn't permit app code to handle manipulation events. If you want to handle manipulations, set [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) to **All**, or to specific [ManipulationModes](../windows.ui.xaml.input/manipulationmodes.md) values. For more info, see [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md).

[ManipulationStarting](uielement_manipulationstarting.md) fires basically any time that a pointer interacts with an element where the element enables manipulation. This includes cases where the manipulation is interpreted as a gesture and the pointers never move, for example a [Tapped](uielement_tapped.md) or [Holding](uielement_holding.md) gesture. If the pointers do move, [ManipulationStarted](uielement_manipulationstarted.md) typically fires thereafter.

[ManipulationStarting](uielement_manipulationstarting.md) is a routed event. If the event is permitted to bubble up to parent elements because it goes unhandled, then it is possible to handle the event on parent elements even if [ManipulationMode](uielement_manipulationmode.md) is **None** or **System** on the parent element. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34c219e8-3efb-45bc-8bbd-6fd937698832).

For touch actions and also for interaction-specific or manipulation events that are consequences of a touch action, an element must be hit-test visible in order to be the event source and fire the event that is associated with the action. [UIElement.Visibility](uielement_visibility.md) must be [Visible](visibility.md). Other properties of derived types also affect hit-test visibility. For more info, see [Events and routed events overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/34c219e8-3efb-45bc-8bbd-6fd937698832).

[ManipulationStarting](uielement_manipulationstarting.md) supports the ability to attach event handlers to the route that will be invoked even if the event data for the event is marked [Handled](../windows.ui.xaml.input/manipulationstartingroutedeventargs_handled.md). See [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_2121467075.md).

### Windows 8 behavior

Windows 8 had an issue with firing this event if multiple gestures happened in a short period of time. For example, Windows 8 might only fire [ManipulationStarting](uielement_manipulationstarting.md) for the first gesture and not the second. The issue is fixed starting with Windows 8.1; multiple starting gestures processed by the input system each fire a distinct [ManipulationStarting](uielement_manipulationstarting.md) event.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 continue to use the Windows 8 behavior.
