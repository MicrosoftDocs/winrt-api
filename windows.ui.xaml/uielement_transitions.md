# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.Transitions

## -description
Gets or sets the collection of [Transition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transition.md) style elements that apply to a [UIElement](uielement.md).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<uielement>
  <uielement.Transitions>
    <TransitionCollection>
      oneOrMoreTransitions
    </TransitionCollection>
  </uielement.Transitions>
</uielement>
```


## -xaml-values
<dl><dt>oneOrMoreTransitions</dt><dd>oneOrMoreTransitionsOne or more object elements instantiating types that are derived from the Transition base type. Typically there is only one of each type of transition included in the collection.</dd>
</dl>
## -property-value
The strongly typed collection of [Transition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transition.md) style elements that apply to a [UIElement](uielement.md).

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to Windows 10, version 1809 (SDK 17763), the XAML syntax for properties that have a [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) value requires that you declare an explicit [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) object element as the value, and then provide object elements as child elements of [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) for each of the transition animations you want to use. In Windows 10, version 1809 (SDK 17763) or later, [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) supports the implicit collection usage, so you can omit the collection object element. For more info on implicit collections and XAML, see [XAML syntax guide](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-syntax-guide).

This is a short list of some of the possible types for transitions:
+ [AddDeleteThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/adddeletethemetransition.md)
+ [ContentThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/contentthemetransition.md)
+ [EdgeUIThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/edgeuithemetransition.md)
+ [EntranceThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/entrancethemetransition.md)
+ [PopupThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/popupthemetransition.md)
+ [ReorderThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/reorderthemetransition.md)
+ [RepositionThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/repositionthemetransition.md)

Specific classes that derive from [UIElement](uielement.md) sometimes have their own properties that hold other types of transitions for class-specific scenarios. For example, [Popup.ChildTransitions](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.primitives/popup_childtransitions.md) and [ItemsControl.ItemContainerTransitions](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/itemscontrol_itemcontainertransitions.md).

Transition animations play a particular role in the UI design of your app. The basic idea is that when there is a change or transition, the animation draws the attention of the user to the change.
<!-- For more info, see  Transition animations and theme animations.-->

It's not common to set the value of the Transitions property directly on a [UIElement](uielement.md) that is a direct element of app UI. It's more common to have a transitions collection be a part of a visual state, template or style. In this case you use mechanisms such as [Setter](setter.md) of a [Style](style.md) to specify the Transitions property, and set the value using XAML-defined content that is typically stored as a XAML resource.

[VisualTransition](visualtransition.md) is not one of the types you put in the UIElement.Transitions collection. [VisualTransition](visualtransition.md) is specifically for animations in visual state groups, and is used by the [VisualStateGroup.Transitions](visualstategroup_transitions.md) property.

This XAML example shows a single [EntranceThemeTransition](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/entrancethemetransition.md) as defined in a [Style](style.md) for a [Button](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/button.md). Transition animation properties are typically set in styles and templates rather than as properties directly in a UI definition. Styles are typically stored as a XAML resource.
