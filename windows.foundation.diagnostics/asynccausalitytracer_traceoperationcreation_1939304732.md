# Windows.Foundation.Diagnostics.AsyncCausalityTracer.TraceOperationCreation

## -description
Logs the creation of an asynchronous operation.

## -parameters
### -param traceLevel
The trace level.

### -param source
The trace source.

### -param platformId
Identifier for the operation type.

### -param operationId
An identifier for the asynchronous operation that's unique within the platform for the operation's lifetime.

### -param operationName
A human-readable description of the asynchronous work.

### -param relatedContext
Additional information related to this operation.

## -remarks
Use the TraceOperationCreation method to log the creation of an asynchronous operation. An asynchronous operation represents a group of zero or more related synchronous work items that may be scheduled in an asynchronous way. Each asynchronous operation has a 128-bit [GUID](/windows/win32/api/guiddef/ns-guiddef-guid) that identifies the operation type, like BCL task and WinJS Promise, and a **UInt64** operation identifier that must be unique within the platform for the lifetime of the asynchronous operation. Good choices for *operationId* include a native pointer to an underlying object, or an integer that's incremented for each new operation. The *operationName* should be a human readable description of the asynchronous work. The *relatedContext* associates any additional information related to this operation.
