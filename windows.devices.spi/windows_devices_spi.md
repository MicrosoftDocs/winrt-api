# Windows.Devices.Spi

## -description

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a high-speed interface used to communicate among integrated components on the same board.

> [!NOTE]
> For info about providers, see the note at the beginning of the [Windows.Devices.Gpio.Provider](/uwp/api/windows.devices.gpio.provider) namespace topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SPI terminology arose in the 1980s, and so some of the language used in the standard is anachronistic. In this documentation we use the term *host* to refer to a device from which the clock signal originates; and *peripheral* to refer to a device that may use and forward the clock signal, but that doesn't originate it. Other documentation resources for SPI might use different terms for those device types, but now that you know the host's and the peripheral's relationship to the clock signal, you'll be able to easily translate between the equivalent terms.
