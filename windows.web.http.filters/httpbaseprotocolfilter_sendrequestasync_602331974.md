# Windows.Web.Http.Filters.HttpBaseProtocolFilter.SendRequestAsync

## -description
Send an HTTP request using the [HttpBaseProtocolFilter](httpbaseprotocolfilter.md) as an asynchronous operation.

## -parameters
### -param request
The HTTP request message to send.

## -returns
The object representing the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
This operation will not block. The returned [IAsyncOperationWithProgress](../windows.foundation/iasyncoperationwithprogress_2.md) (of [HttpResponseMessage](/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpresponsemessage) and [HttpProgress](/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpprogress)) completes once the entire HTTP response message is received.

Below are exceptions that this function throws.

### E_INVALIDARG
The *request* parameter was a **null** reference (**Nothing** in Visual Basic).

### E_ILLEGAL_METHOD_CALL
The request message was already sent by the [HttpBaseProtocolFilter](httpbaseprotocolfilter.md) instance.
