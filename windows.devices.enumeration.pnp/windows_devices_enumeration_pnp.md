# Windows.Devices.Enumeration.Pnp

## -description
Provides classes for enumerating a collection of Pnp device objects, and event handlers for monitoring changes to the objects in the collection asynchronously.
The following are typical uses of the Windows.Devices.Enumeration.Pnp API.

+ Building a user interface for selecting the device to be used by an application. For example, a voice chat application may present a list of microphones or webcams for the user to select from, or a photo import application may present a list of removable storage devices for the user to import photos from.
+ Device discovery and notifications about devices for apps that use them, like [](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/br259108.aspx).
