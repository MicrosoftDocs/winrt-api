# Windows.Graphics.Printing3D

## -description

Provides APIs for working with 3D printers.

## -remarks

These APIs are designed for use with 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) packages. For more information about 3MF, see the [3MF Specification](http://3mf.io/what-is-3mf/3mf-specification/).

To learn more about the 3D model repair algorithm implemented in these APIs and test it out quickly, go to the [3D Model Repair service](https://aka.ms/modelrepair).
