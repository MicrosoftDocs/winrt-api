# Windows.UI.Input.RadialController.ButtonClicked

## -description
Occurs when the wheel device is pressed and then released while a custom [RadialController](radialcontroller.md) tool is active.


Your app does not receive this event when:

+ The [RadialController](radialcontroller.md) menu is active
+ A built-in tool is active


> [!NOTE]
> When a time threshold is crossed, click becomes a press and hold action. In this case, the integrated menu of contextual app commands associated with the [RadialController](radialcontroller.md) object is displayed, and subsequent rotate and click events are processed by the menu.
