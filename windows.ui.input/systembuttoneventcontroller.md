# Windows.UI.Input.SystemButtonEventController

## -description

Enables the ability to handle events generated by hardware system buttons (such as the Function buttons).

## -remarks

This API is intended for use by Accessibility tools as a low level hook for intercepting events from hardware system buttons.

[SystemButtonEventController](systembuttoneventcontroller.md) event registration applies system wide and is first-come, first-served. If an application or service sets a SystemButtonEventController event Handled property to true, applications or services that registered after that app or service for the same event notification will not receive the notification.
