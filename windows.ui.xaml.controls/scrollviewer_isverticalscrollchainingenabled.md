# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ScrollViewer.IsVerticalScrollChainingEnabled

## -description
Gets or sets a value that indicates whether scroll chaining is enabled from this child to its parent, for the vertical axis.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<ScrollViewer IsVerticalScrollChainingEnabled="bool" />
-or-
<object ScrollViewer.IsVerticalScrollChainingEnabled="bool"/>
```


## -property-value
**true** to enable vertical scroll chaining from child to parent; otherwise, **false**.

## -remarks

After a user hits a scroll limit on an element that has been nested within another scrollable element, you can specify whether that parent element should continue the scrolling operation begun in its child element. This is called scroll chaining.

For more info, see [Guidelines for panning](/windows/uwp/design/input/guidelines-for-panning).

For XAML usage, IsVerticalScrollChainingEnabled can either be an attribute on an explicit [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) element, or a **ScrollViewer.IsVerticalScrollChainingEnabled** attached property usage on an element that is a child of a control that supports scrollview implicitly in its template. 

The ScrollViewer's chaining properties ([IsHorizontalScrollChainingEnabled](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.scrollviewer.ishorizontalscrollchainingenabled),[IsVerticalScrollChainingEnabled](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.scrollviewer.isverticalscrollchainingenabled), [IsZoomChainingEnabled](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.scrollviewer.iszoomchainingenabled) ) do not apply when the control is in inertial mode. Because mouse wheel rotations are handled as **inertial manipulations**, chaining does not work.
<!--May not work because there is no apparent templatebinding linkage in most of the generic templates.-->
