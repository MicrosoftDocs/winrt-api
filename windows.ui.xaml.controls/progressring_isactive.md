# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ProgressRing.IsActive

## -description
Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the [ProgressRing](progressring.md) is showing progress.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<ProgressRing IsActive="bool" />
```


## -property-value
**True** if the [ProgressRing](progressring.md) is showing progress; otherwise, **false**. The default is **false**.

## -remarks
Set the IsActive property to turn the [ProgressRing](progressring.md) on or off. If IsActive is false, the [ProgressRing](progressring.md) is not shown, but space is reserved for it in the UI layout. To not reserve space for the [ProgressRing](progressring.md), set it's [Visibility](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_visibility.md) property to [Collapsed](../windows.ui.xaml/visibility.md).

### Notes for Windows 8.x

> **Windows 8.x**
> In an app compiled for WindowsÂ 8, when the [ProgressRing](progressring.md) is active, the progress animation continues even if its not visible on the screen, such as when its [Visibility](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_visibility.md) is [Collapsed](../windows.ui.xaml/visibility.md). This can keep the UI thread awake, use resources, and impair app performance. When the [ProgressRing](progressring.md) is not visible, you should disable the animation by setting IsActive to **false**.
