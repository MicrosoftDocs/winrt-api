# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RichTextBlock.CharacterSpacing

## -description
Gets or sets the uniform spacing between characters, in units of 1/1000 of an em.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<RichTextBlockÂ CharacterSpacing="int"/>
```


## -property-value
The uniform spacing between characters, in units of 1/1000 of an em. The default is 0. Positive values increase tracking and loosen character spacing. Negative values decrease tracking and tighten the character spacing.

## -remarks
*Tracking* is the typographic term for an amount of space added or removed between all pairs of characters in a portion of text. This feature can be accessed through the CharacterSpacing property on [TextBlock](textblock.md) and [RichTextBlock](richtextblock.md). CharacterSpacing is measured in 1/1000 of an "em". One "em" is equivalent to the current font size of the control. For example, an additional 14 pixels will be inserted between each character in a text control with `FontSize="14"` and `CharacterSpacing="1000"`.
