# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.INavigate

## -description
Defines the navigation action for navigation hosts and navigation initiators.



## -remarks
This interface is mainly infrastructure. It's not expected that typical UWP app will implement this interface. Most apps would use [Page](page.md) and [Frame](frame.md) for their navigation structure instead. The Visual Studio templates create this navigation structure for you both for apps/projects and for items/pages.

## -examples

[Frame](frame.md), [Frame.Navigate](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.frame.navigate)
