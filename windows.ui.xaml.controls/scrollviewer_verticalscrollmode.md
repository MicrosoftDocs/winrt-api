# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollMode

## -description
Gets or sets a value that determines how manipulation input influences scrolling behavior on the vertical axis.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<ScrollViewer VerticalScrollMode="scrollModeMemberName" />
-or-
<object ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollMode="scrollModeMemberName"/>
```


## -property-value
A value of the enumeration. The typical default (as set through the default template, not class initialization) is **Enabled**.

## -remarks
Scrolling behavior can also be set through a `ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollMode` XAML attached property usage, or by calling [SetVerticalScrollMode](scrollviewer_setverticalscrollmode_1928942593.md). This is for cases where the [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) is implicit, such as when the [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) exists in the default template for a [GridView](gridview.md), and you want to be able to influence the scrolling behavior without accessing template parts. Controls with a [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) as part of their composition typically use template binding such that setting the attached property at the level of the control will change the scroll behavior of the [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) part within the control. Otherwise, it may be necessary to replace the template in order to change the scroll behavior of a [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) part.
