## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to Windows 10, version 1809 (SDK 17763), the XAML syntax for properties that have a [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) value requires that you declare an explicit [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) object element as the value, and then provide object elements as child elements of [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) for each of the transition animations you want to use. In Windows 10, version 1809 (SDK 17763) or later, [TransitionCollection](../windows.ui.xaml.media.animation/transitioncollection.md) supports the implicit collection usage, so you can omit the collection object element. For more info on implicit collections and XAML, see [XAML syntax guide](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-syntax-guide).

Transition animations play a particular role in UI design of your app. The basic idea is that when there is a change or transition, the animation draws the attention of the user to the change.
<!-- For more info, see  Transition animations and theme animations.-->
It's not common to set the value of the [ContentTransitions](contentcontrol_contenttransitions.md)property directly on a [ContentControl](contentcontrol.md)type that is a direct element of app UI. It's more common to have a transitions collection be a part of a visual state, template or style. In this case you use mechanisms such as [Setter](../windows.ui.xaml/setter.md)of a [Style](../windows.ui.xaml/style.md)to specify the [ContentTransitions](contentcontrol_contenttransitions.md)property. Styles are typically stored as a XAML resource.
