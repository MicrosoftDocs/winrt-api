# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RelativePanel.SetAlignLeftWithPanel

## -parameters

The object to which the property value is written.

### -param value
The value to set. (**true** to align this element's left edge with the panel's left edge; otherwise, **false**.)

## -remarks
This method is a utility method for the property system, and isn't used in most app scenarios.
