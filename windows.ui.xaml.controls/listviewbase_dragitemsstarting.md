# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ListViewBase.DragItemsStarting

## -description
Occurs when a drag operation that involves one of the items in the view is initiated.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<listViewBase DragItemsStarting="eventhandler" />
```


## -remarks
This event occurs when you start a drag-and-drop operation, including when you perform a reorder operation by drag-and-drop. When you perform custom actions as a result of a drag-and-drop operation, you typically listen to this event and provide more data using the [DragItemsStartingEventArgs.Data](dragitemsstartingeventargs_data.md) property.

You can inspect the items being dragged by checking the [DragItemsStartingEventArgs.Items](dragitemsstartingeventargs_items.md) property.

You can cancel the drag operation by setting the [DragItemsStartingEventArgs.Cancel](dragitemsstartingeventargs_cancel.md) property to **true**.
