# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RelativePanel.AlignBottomWithPanelProperty

## -description
Identifies the [RelativePanel.AlignBottomWithPanel](relativepanel_alignbottomwithpanel.md) XAML attached property.



## -property-value
The identifier for the [RelativePanel.AlignBottomWithPanel](relativepanel_alignbottomwithpanel.md) XAML attached property.

## -remarks
This property is only an identifier for the property system, and isn't used in most app scenarios. In most cases you set the [RelativePanel.AlignBottomWithPanel](relativepanel_alignbottomwithpanel.md) XAML attached property in XAML and won't need this identifier.

To access the [RelativePanel.AlignBottomWithPanel](relativepanel_alignbottomwithpanel.md) attached property in code, you can use the dependency property system, calling either [GetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_getvalue_1188551207.md) or [SetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_setvalue_52578133.md) and passing RelativePanel.AlignBottomWithPanelProperty as the dependency property identifier. Another way to get or set the value in code is to use [GetAlignBottomWithPanel](relativepanel_getalignbottomwithpanel_1516633148.md) and [SetAlignBottomWithPanel](relativepanel_setalignbottomwithpanel_1908110608.md).
