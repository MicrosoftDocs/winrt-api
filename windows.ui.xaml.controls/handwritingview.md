Represents a Windows Ink input surface for text input controls.

## -remarks

> [!TIP]
> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Text input with the handwriting view](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/text-handwriting-view).

The **HandwritingView** is supported by text input controls such as [TextBox](textbox.md), [RichEditBox](richeditbox.md), and composite text controls such as [AutoSuggestBox](autosuggestbox.md).

When a user taps into a text input box using a Windows pen, the text box transforms to let the user write directly into it with a pen, rather than opening a separate input panel.
