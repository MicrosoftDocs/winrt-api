# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ListViewBase.CanDragItems

## -description
Gets or sets a value that indicates whether items in the view can be dragged as data payload.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<listViewBase CanDragItems="bool" />
```


## -property-value
**True** if items in the view can be dragged as data payload; otherwise, **false**. The default is **false**.

## -remarks
Setting [IsSwipeEnabled](listviewbase_isswipeenabled.md) to **false** disables some default touch interactions, so it should be set to **true** when these interactions are needed. For example:
+ If item selection is enabled and you set [IsSwipeEnabled](listviewbase_isswipeenabled.md) to **false**, a user can deselect items by right-clicking with the mouse, but can't deselect an item with touch by using a *swipe* gesture.
+ If you set CanDragItems to **true** and [IsSwipeEnabled](listviewbase_isswipeenabled.md) to **false**, a user can drag items with the mouse, but not with touch.
+ If you set [CanReorderItems](listviewbase_canreorderitems.md) to **true** and [IsSwipeEnabled](listviewbase_isswipeenabled.md) to **false**, a user can reorder items with the mouse, but not with touch.


CanDragItems can be set to false as part of visual states that are intended to prevent users from dragging items in views such as a [GridView](gridview.md).

CanDragItems does not reflect transient states that might influence the ability to drag items, such as item population lag. The primary scenario where you might get the value of CanDragItems in code is to verify that dynamic templates or user-selectable options in your app UI have not changed the value since you last set it.
