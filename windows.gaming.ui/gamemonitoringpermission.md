## -enum-fields

## -remarks

These APIs work with **TruePlay**, a system on Windows 10 that helps to combat cheating in PC games. A game enrolled in TruePlay will run in a protected process, which mitigates a class of common attacks. The TruePlay APIs for UWP allow limited interaction between games and the game monitoring system on Windows 10 PCs.

You can use these WinRT APIs, in tandem with the native APIs in **&lt;gamemonitor.h&gt;**, to work with the game monitoring system. See [TruePlay](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/mt808781) for more information.
