# Windows.Perception.Spatial.SpatialLocator

## -description
Provides access to the location of a device that's tracked relative to the user's surroundings, such as a HoloLens or other Mixed Reality headset.

## -remarks
The SpatialLocator class represents a device whose position and orientation can be tracked by Windows relative to the user's surroundings. A SpatialLocator instance is the source for locator-attached and stationary frames of reference. On a Mixed Reality headset such as HoloLens, these frames of reference can be used for holographic rendering and for reasoning about surfaces in the world around the device.
