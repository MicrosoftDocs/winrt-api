# Windows.Networking.BackgroundTransfer.DownloadOperation.Pause

## -description
Pauses a download operation.

## -remarks
Calling this method aborts the HTTP request, but preserves state for the download and for the partially downloaded response. This method fails when called for an operation that either: hasn't been started yet; is already paused; or that uses a POST request. To detect when the operation is fully paused, get the value of the [Progress property](/uwp/api/windows.networking.backgroundtransfer.downloadoperation.progress), and then access the [Status field](/uwp/api/windows.networking.backgroundtransfer.backgrounddownloadprogress.status) of that value. When the operation is fully paused, the *Status* field's value will no longer be **Running**. This is important if you need to pause an operation and then change [RequestedUri](/uwp/api/windows.networking.backgroundtransfer.downloadoperation.requesteduri), because you can't make that change while the the *Status* field's value is **Running**.
