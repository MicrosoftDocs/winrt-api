## -description
> [!NOTE]
> SettingsPaneCommandsRequest is deprecated, and might not work on all versions of Windows 10. Instead of using a [SettingsPane](settingspane.md), integrate settings options into the app experience. For more info, see [Guidelines for app settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-settings/guidelines-for-app-settings).

Contains properties that are only available during the [CommandsRequested](settingspane_commandsrequested.md) event.
