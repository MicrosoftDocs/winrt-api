# Windows.UI.ApplicationSettings.SettingsPaneCommandsRequest

## -description
> [!NOTE]
> SettingsPaneCommandsRequest is deprecated, and might not work on all versions of Windows 10. Instead of using a [SettingsPane](settingspane.md), integrate settings options into the app experience. For more info, see [Guidelines for app settings](/windows/uwp/app-settings/guidelines-for-app-settings).

Contains properties that are only available during the [CommandsRequested](settingspane_commandsrequested.md) event.

## -remarks

<!-- confirmed -->
> [!NOTE]
> This class is not agile, which means that you need to consider its threading model and marshaling behavior. For more info, see [Threading and Marshaling (C++/CX)](/cpp/cppcx/threading-and-marshaling-c-cx) and [Using Windows Runtime objects in a multithreaded environment (.NET)](/windows/uwp/threading-async/using-windows-runtime-objects-in-a-multithreaded-environment).
