> This class is not agile, which means that you need to consider its threading model and marshaling behavior. For more info, see [Threading and Marshaling (C++/CX)](/cpp/cppcx/threading-and-marshaling-c-cx) and [Using Windows Runtime objects in a multithreaded environment (.NET)](/windows/uwp/threading-async/using-windows-runtime-objects-in-a-multithreaded-environment).
