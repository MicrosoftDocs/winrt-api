public Windows.Foundation.IAsyncAction ShowManageAccountsAsync()
-->

# Windows.UI.ApplicationSettings.AccountsSettingsPane.ShowManageAccountsAsync

## -description
Displays the manage accounts screen.

## -returns
Represents the asynchronous action. You usually don't access this [IAsyncAction](../windows.foundation/iasyncaction.md) return value directly. That's because you almost always use the language-specific awaitable syntax. In this case, the apparent return value of the method is **void**.

The asynchronous action completes when the user has dismissed the manage accounts screen.
