## -remarks
Mobile operator UWP app can have access to different states of the device. Access to the device states such as device readiness, account activation state, and device lock status are made available through the [NetworkDeviceStatus](networkdevicestatus.md) enumeration. The radio state information is available through the [CurrentRadioState](mobilebroadbanddeviceinformation_currentradiostate.md) enumeration. Note that these are two different states. For example, a radio state **Off** does not translate to a **DeviceNotReady** state and vice versa.
