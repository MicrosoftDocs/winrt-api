## -remarks
The [ShowConnectionUI](mobilebroadbandnetwork_showconnectionui_1443464048.md) method is useful if you determine that connecting to a different network is preferred due to a roaming relationship, pricing changes, and so on. For example, when your app determines that a different network is preferred, you can inform the user of the preferred network. If the user decides to change networks, you can call the [ShowConnectionUI](mobilebroadbandnetwork_showconnectionui_1443464048.md) for the preferred network to complete the connection.
