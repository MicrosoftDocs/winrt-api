## -remarks
You can begin the process of stopping a [MobileBroadbandAccountWatcher](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher.md) by calling the [Stop](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_stop_1201535524.md) method. When the [MobileBroadbandAccountWatcher](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher.md) fully stops, the [Stopped](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_stopped.md) event is raised.

You can query the status of a watcher using the [Status](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_status.md) property to determine if the watcher was aborted due to an unexpected internal error condition.
