# Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.MobileBroadbandAccountWatcher.Start

## -description
Starts the account watcher.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is only available to mobile operator apps and UWP apps given privileged access by mobile network operators.



> If you want to use this API and publish your app to the Store, you will need special approval. For more information, see the **Special and restricted capabilities** section under [App capability declarations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations). 

## -remarks
When you start the account watcher, it first enumerates all Mobile Broadband Accounts and raises an [AccountAdded](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_accountadded.md) event for each account found. When the enumeration operation is completed, the account watcher raises the [EnumerationCompleted](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_enumerationcompleted.md) event. After the [EnumerationCompleted](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_enumerationcompleted.md) event is raised, the account watcher continues to raise account-related events ([AccountAdded](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_accountadded.md), [AccountUpdated](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_accountupdated.md), and [AccountRemoved](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_accountremoved.md)) until you call the [Stop](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_stop_1201535524.md) method.

Note that you do not need to explicitly stop and start the account watcher on App Suspend/Resume events. Instead, starting and starting the watcher is handled by the API itself.
