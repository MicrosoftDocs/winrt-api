# Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.MobileBroadbandAccountWatcher.EnumerationCompleted

## -description
Occurs when the account watcher has finished enumerating accounts for the client.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is only available to mobile operator apps and UWP apps given privileged access by mobile network operators.



> If you want to use this API and publish your app to the Store, you will need special approval. For more information, see the **Special and restricted capabilities** section under [App capability declarations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations). 

## -remarks
When the watcher is started, it enumerates all existing accounts (raising an [AccountAdded](mobilebroadbandaccountwatcher_accountadded.md) event for each account). You can use the **EnumerationCompleted** event to determine when the enumeration operation has finished. After that, all proceeding events are new.
