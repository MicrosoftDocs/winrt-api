# Windows.Media.Capture.Core.VariablePhotoSequenceCapture

## -description
Provides methods and events that enable the capture of variable photo sequences.

## -remarks
Call the [MediaCapture.PrepareVariablePhotoSequenceCaptureAsync](../windows.media.capture/mediacapture_preparevariablephotosequencecaptureasync_262453199.md) method to obtain an instance of this class.

After starting a variable photo sequence capture, you must stop the variable photo sequence capture by calling [StopAsync](variablephotosequencecapture_stopasync_1648475005.md) before your app attempts to record video with the [MediaCapture](../windows.media.capture/mediacapture.md) object.
