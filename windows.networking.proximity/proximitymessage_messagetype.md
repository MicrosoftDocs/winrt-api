## -description
Gets the type of the message.

## -property-value
The type of the message.

## -remarks
Messages are delivered to all applications that have subscribed to the message type (as indicated by the *messageType* parameter). Message type values are case-sensitive strings that consist of two parts: the *protocol* and the subtype. The *protocol* is first, followed by a dot (.) and then the *subtype*. For the [PublishMessage](proximitydevice_publishmessage_1881696512.md) method, the *protocol* must always be "Windows.". The *subtype* is a string of alphanumeric characters and the following additional characters: **. ( ) + , - : = @ ; $ _ ! * â€™**. The *subtype* cannot exceed a length of 250 characters.
