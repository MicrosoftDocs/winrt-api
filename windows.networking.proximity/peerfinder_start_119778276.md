# Windows.Networking.Proximity.PeerFinder.Start

## -description
Makes an app discoverable to remote peers.

## -parameters
### -param peerMessage
The message to deliver to the proximate device.

## -remarks
You can call the **Start** method to begin the process of finding a peer app and to make your app discoverable to remote peers that call the [FindAllPeersAsync](peerfinder_findallpeersasync_830195586.md) method. A peer is a device that has an app running in the foreground with a matching AppId. A peer can also have a matching Browse Id that's specified as an alternate identity. For more information, see [AlternateIdentities](peerfinder_alternateidentities.md).

You can use this overload of the Start method to send a message to a peer app that will be passed as an app activation argument.

You can connect to only one peer at a time if your app is in the peer or client role. If your app is in the host role, you can connect up to 5 clients at a time.

When an app is activated by tapping a nearby device, the activation parameters indicate whether the [PeerFinder](peerfinder.md) should be started or if the app was launched with activation arguments. The format of the activation parameters is *"Windows.Networking.Proximity.PeerFinder:StreamSocket Role=&lt;Host|Client&gt;"*. For more information, see the "Activating apps using Proximity" section of [Supporting Proximity and Tapping.](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh465229(v=win.10))



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always set the [DisplayName](peerfinder_displayname.md) property to a unique value for your app before you call the Start method.
