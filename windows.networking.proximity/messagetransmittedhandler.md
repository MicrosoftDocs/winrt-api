<!-- Delegate syntax.
public delegate void MessageTransmittedHandler(Windows.Networking.Proximity.ProximityDevice sender, System.Int64 messageId)
-->
# Windows.Networking.Proximity.MessageTransmittedHandler

## -description
Describes the method that will handle the event that's fired when a published message has been transmitted.

## -parameters
### -param sender
The proximity device that published the message.

### -param messageId
The publication ID of the message.


## -remarks
Messages continue to be published until the [StopPublishingMessage](proximitydevice_stoppublishingmessage_1046474884.md) method is called or the [ProximityDevice](proximitydevice.md) on the publishing computer is released. Messages are delivered to all apps that have subscribed for the same message type.

When using the [PublishMessage](proximitydevice_publishmessage_1881696512.md) method, the only supported message type is one that begins with "Windows.". To publish messages using another message type, such as "WindowsMime." or "NDEF:WriteTag", you must use the [PublishBinaryMessage](proximitydevice_publishbinarymessage_285088637.md) method.

The MessageTransmittedHandler delegate is called each time a message is successfully transmitted to a device, regardless of whether any apps were subscribed to the message on that device.
