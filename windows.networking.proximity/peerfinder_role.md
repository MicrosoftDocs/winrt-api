# Windows.Networking.Proximity.PeerFinder.Role

## -description
Gets or sets the role of the app in peer-to-peer connections.

## -property-value
The role of the app in peer-to-peer connections.

## -remarks
The Role property is used in multi-peer app connections to identify whether the peer app is the **Host** or **Client**, or if the peer app is participating in a two-peer connection as a **Peer**. For multi-peer app connections, you must set the Role property before calling the [Start](peerfinder_start_119778276.md) method. If the Role property is not set, the default is **Peer**.

In a multi-peer app scenario, the Role identifies the capability of the apps to connect. A **Host** app can connect to up to five **Client** apps. **Host** apps can only discover apps that advertise as **Client** apps. **Client** apps can only discover apps that advertise as **Host** apps. The **Peer** role identifies a two-app scenario. Therefore, **Peer** apps can only discover other **Peer** apps. The same rules apply for peer apps connected using a tap gesture. For example, apps advertising as **Host** apps can only tap to connect with apps advertising as **Client** apps.
