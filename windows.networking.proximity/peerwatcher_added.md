# Windows.Networking.Proximity.PeerWatcher.Added

## -description
Occurs when a peer app is found within wireless range.

## -remarks
> > [!IMPORTANT]
> For Windows Phone 8.x apps, calling [PeerFinder.ConnectAsync](peerfinder_connectasync_380619906.md) from within an Added event handler will fail. Instead, call it outside of this event handler, for example, when the user has explicitly chosen to connect to a peer.

After you start the [PeerWatcher](peerwatcher.md)by calling the [Start](peerfinder_start_119778276.md)method, the Addedevent is raised for each peer app found within wireless range. The [PeerWatcher](peerwatcher.md)continues scanning for peer apps within range until you call the [Stop](peerwatcher_stop_1201535524.md)method. Using the Addedevent, you can display peer apps to the user as they are found.
