-->

# Windows.Networking.Proximity.PeerWatcher.EnumerationCompleted

## -description
Occurs after a scan operation is complete and all peer apps within wireless range have been found.

## -remarks
EnumerationCompleted event is raised when an enumeration looking for peer apps within range is complete. 

> > [!IMPORTANT]
> For Windows Phone 8.x apps, calling [PeerFinder.ConnectAsync](peerfinder_connectasync_380619906.md) from within an EnumerationCompleted event handler will fail. Instead, call it outside of this event handler, for example, when the user has explicitly chosen to connect to a peer.
