# CompositionBitmapInterpolationMode

## -description
Specifies the algorithm used for interpolating pixels from ICompositionSurface when they do not form a one-to-one mapping to pixels on screen.

## -enum-fields

### -field NearestNeighbor:0

Use the exact color of the nearest bitmap pixel to the current rendering pixel.

### -field Linear:1

Interpolate a color from the four bitmap pixels that are the nearest to the current rendering pixel.

### -field MagLinearMinLinearMipLinear:2

Use Linear interpolation for magnification, minification, and mip-level sampling.

### -field MagLinearMinLinearMipNearest:3

Use Linear interpolation for magnification and minification; use NearestNeighbor for mip-level sampling.

### -field MagNearestMinNearestMipLinear:8

Use NearestNeighbor for magnification and minification; use Linear interpolation for mip-level sampling.

### -field MagNearestMinNearestMipNearest:9

Use NearestNeighbor for magnification, minification, and mip-level sampling.

## -remarks
Interpolating pixels is necessary when the pixels of an [ICompositionSurface](icompositionsurface.md) do not form a one-to-one mapping to the pixels of a [SpriteVisual](spritevisual.md); this can happen under scale, stretch, rotation, skew, or other transformations (such as perspective projection, etc.).

When the bitmap contents of an [ICompositionSurface](icompositionsurface.md) are mapped to a [SpriteVisual](spritevisual.md) whose size is larger than that of the bitmap, each pixel from the surface must be mapped to a group of pixels on screen.

Conversely, when the bitmap contents of an [ICompositionSurface](icompositionsurface.md) are mapped to a [SpriteVisual](spritevisual.md) whose size is smaller than that of the bitmap, multiple pixels from the surface must be mapped to single pixels on screen.
