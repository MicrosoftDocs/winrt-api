## -enum-fields
### -field SetInitialValueBeforeDelay:1
Applies the initial value of the animation (i.e. the value at Keyframe 0) to the object before the delay time is elapsed (when there is a DelayTime specified), it then delays starting the animation according to the DelayTime. 

### -field SetInitialValueAfterDelay:0
Does not compute anything in animation nor holds the value of composition object property. If a DelayTime is specified, it delays starting the animation according to delay time and after delay has expired it applies animation to the object property.
