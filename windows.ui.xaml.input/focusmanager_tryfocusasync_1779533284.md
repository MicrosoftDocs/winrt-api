# Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.FocusManager.TryFocusAsync

## -description

Asynchronously attempts to set focus on an element when the application is initialized. 

## -parameters

### -param element

The object on which to set focus.

### -param value

One of the values from the [FocusState](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.focusstate) enumeration that specify how an elemnent can obtain focus.

## -returns

The [FocusMovementResult](focusmovementresult.md) that indicates whether focus was successfully set.

## -remarks

Some objects, such as a [WebView](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/webview.md), can run in either the app process or in a separate process (see [WebViewExecutionMode.SeparateProcess](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/webviewexecutionmode.md)). 

When an object runs in the app process, the following focus events occur as expected for both the previously focused object and the newly focused object:
- [GettingFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_gettingfocus.md)
- [LosingFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_losingfocus.md)
- [GotFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_gotfocus.md)
- [LostFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_lostfocus.md)

However, if the newly focused object is running in a separate process some of these event behaviors can differ. 

- [GetFocusedElement](focusmanager_getfocusedelement_1183614552.md) does not return the newly focused object until the [TryFocusAsync](focusmanager_tryfocusasync_1779533284.md) operation completes. 
- The control losing focus receives its [LosingFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_losingfocus.md) event synchronously, but does not receive [LostFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_lostfocus.md) until the asynchronous operation completes. 
- The control getting focus receieves its [GettingFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_gettingfocus.md) event synchronously, but does not receive [GotFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_gotfocus.md) until the asynchronous operation completes. 
 
[TryFocusAsync](focusmanager_tryfocusasync_1779533284.md) completes synchronously when called on an element running in the app process. 
 
## -examples

Here, we show how to set focus on a WebView object, and, if that fails, restore focus to the original element. 

```csharp
async void MoveFocus(WebView webView)) 
{ 
    FocusMovementResult result; 
    result = await FocusManager.TryFocusAsync(webView, FocusState.Programmatic); 
    if (!result.Succeeded) 
    { 
        // Restore focus to original element. 
        this.Focus(FocusState.Programmatic); 
    } 
}
```
