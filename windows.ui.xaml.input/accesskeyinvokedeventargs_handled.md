# Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.AccessKeyInvokedEventArgs.Handled

## -description
Gets or sets a value that marks the routed event as handled. A **true** value for Handled prevents most handlers along the event route from handling the same event again.



## -property-value
**true** to mark the routed event handled. **false** to leave the routed event unhandled, which permits the event to potentially route further and be acted on by other handlers. The default is **false**.
