# Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.GettingFocusEventArgs.Handled

## -description

Gets or sets a value that marks the routed event as handled. A **true** value for **Handled** prevents most handlers along the event route from handling the same event again.

## -property-value

**true** to mark the routed event handled. **false** to leave the routed event unhandled, which permits the event to potentially route further and be acted on by other handlers. The default is **false**.
