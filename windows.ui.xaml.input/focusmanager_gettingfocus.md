# Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.FocusManager.GettingFocus

## -description

Occurs before an element actually receives focus. This event is raised synchronously to ensure focus isn't moved while the event is bubbling.

## -remarks

We recommend using the [UIElement](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement.md) focus routed events instead of [FocusManager](focusmanager.md) events whenever possible.

[FocusNavigationDirection.Previous](focusnavigationdirection.md) and [FocusNavigationDirection.Next](focusnavigationdirection.md) cannot be used with [FindNextElementOptions](findnextelementoptions.md). Only [FocusNavigationDirection.Up](focusnavigationdirection.md), [FocusNavigationDirection.Down](focusnavigationdirection.md), [FocusNavigationDirection.Left](focusnavigationdirection.md), or [FocusNavigationDirection.Right](focusnavigationdirection.md) are valid.

UIElement focus events bubble up to the FocusManager in the following order:

1. [UIElement.LosingFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_losingfocus.md)/[FocusManager.LosingFocus](focusmanager_losingfocus.md)
2. [UIElement.GettingFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_gettingfocus.md)/FocusManager.GettingFocus
3. [UIElement.LostFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_lostfocus.md) routed event is raised by the element that lost focus and the event bubbles up
4. [FocusManager.LostFocus](focusmanager_lostfocus.md) is raised (even if the routed event is marked handled)
5. [UIElement.GotFocus](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_gotfocus.md) routed event is raised by the element that received focus and the event bubbles up
6. [FocusManager.GotFocus](focusmanager_gotfocus.md) is raised (even if the routed event is marked handled)
