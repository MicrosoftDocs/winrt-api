# Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.FocusManager.FindNextFocusableElement

## -description

Retrieves the element that should receive focus based on the specified navigation direction and hint rectangle.

## -parameters

### -param focusNavigationDirection

The direction that focus moves from element to element within the app UI.

### -param hintRect

A bounding rectangle used to influence which element is most likely to be considered the next to receive focus. Examples where this can be useful include:

- When no element currently has focus, specifying a small rectangle at a screen location of (-1, -1) starts focus from the upper left corner of the display.
- In a program guide where you want to ensure programs at the current time receive focus. (The focus algorithm might favor shows at a later time based on a number of factors.)

## -returns

**null** if focus cannot be set in the specified direction.

## -remarks

You can also use either the [FindNextElement(FocusNavigationDirection, FindNextElementOptions)](focusmanager_findnextelement_918683319.md) method or the [FindNextElement(FocusNavigationDirection)](focusmanager_findnextelement_1379272417.md) method to programmatically move focus. These methods retrieve the element (as a [DependencyObject](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject.md)) that will receive focus based on the specified navigation direction (directional navigation only, cannot be used to emulate tab navigation).

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using the FindNextElement method instead of FindNextFocusableElement because FindNextFocusableElement retrieves a UIElement, which returns null if the next focusable element is not a UIElement (such as a [Hyperlink](../windows.ui.xaml.documents/hyperlink.md) object).
