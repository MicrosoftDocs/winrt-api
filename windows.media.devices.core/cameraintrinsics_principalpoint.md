# Windows.Media.Devices.Core.CameraIntrinsics.PrincipalPoint

## -description
Gets the principal point of the camera.

## -property-value
The principal point of the camera.

## -remarks
The principal point is expressed in pixels, not in normalized coordinates. The origin [0,0] is the bottom, left corner of the image (+Y pointing up). Note that this differs from typical image coordinates which have the origin in the top, left corner of the image (+Y pointing down).
