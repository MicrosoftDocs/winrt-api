# Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystem

## -description

This class manages the attributes of a discovered remote system (device) and provides the capabilities to discover remote systems as part of Project Rome.

## -remarks

This class is instantiated whenever a remote system (device) is discovered, is updated, or disappears (the instance is referenced as a property of the [RemoteSystemAddedEventArgs](remotesystemaddedeventargs.md), [RemoteSystemUpdatedEventArgs](remotesystemupdatedeventargs.md), or [RemoteSystemRemovedEventArgs](remotesystemremovedeventargs.md) class).

The properties of the [RemoteSystem](remotesystem.md) class are used to determine the operations that can be done on a given remote system.
