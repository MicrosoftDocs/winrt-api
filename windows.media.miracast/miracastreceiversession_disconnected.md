# Windows.Media.Miracast.MiracastReceiverSession.Disconnected

## -description

An event which is raised when a [MiracastReceiverConnection](miracastreceiverconnection.md) has been disconnected by the Miracast Transmitter.

## -remarks

The app must subscribe to this event before invoking the [MiracastReceiverSession.Start](miracastreceiversession_start_1587696324) or [MiracastReceiverSession.StartAsync](miracastreceiversession_startasync_1931900819.md) method.

The event is not raised if the app itself requested the connection to be disconnected, for example, by invoking the Disconnect method.

Apps should check the [MiracastReceiverDisconnectedEventArgs.Connection](miracastreceiverdisconnectedeventargs_connection.md) property to determine which connection was disconnected as a MiracastReceiverSession can handle multiple connections.
