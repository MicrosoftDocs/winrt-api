## -remarks

Use a value from the CommonFolderQuery enumeration when you call one of the following methods of the [StorageFolder](../windows.storage/storagefolder.md) class. For examples that use values from the CommonFolderQuery enumeration, see the topics for these methods.

+ [CreateFolderQuery(CommonFolderQuery)](../windows.storage/storagefolder_createfolderquery_330767063.md)
+ [CreateFolderQueryWithOptions](istoragefolderqueryoperations_createfolderquerywithoptions_573382953.md). Instantiate the [QueryOptions](queryoptions_queryoptions_1209951623.md) with the [QueryOptions(CommonFolderQuery)](queryoptions_queryoptions_1209951623.md) constructor.
+ [CreateItemQueryWithOptions](../windows.storage/storagefolder_createitemquerywithoptions_1519361285.md). Instantiate the [QueryOptions](queryoptions_queryoptions_1209951623.md) with the [QueryOptions(CommonFolderQuery)](queryoptions_queryoptions_1209951623.md) constructor.
+ [GetFoldersAsync(CommonFolderQuery)](../windows.storage/storagefolder_getfoldersasync_595997124.md)
+ [GetFoldersAsync(CommonFolderQuery, UInt32, UInt32)](../windows.storage/storagefolder_getfoldersasync_731846614.md)

These methods use the value from the CommonFolderQuery enumeration to initialize the [DateStackOption](queryoptions_datestackoption.md), [FolderDepth](queryoptions_folderdepth.md), [IndexerOption](queryoptions_indexeroption.md), and [SortOrder](queryoptions_sortorder.md) options of the query.

Call the [StorageFolder.IsCommonFolderQuerySupported](../windows.storage/storagefolder_iscommonfolderquerysupported_1797734947.md) method to determine whether the CommonFolderQuery value that you want to use is available for the current folder.

> > [!TIP]
> When a query groups files into virtual folders based on a property that can have multiple values (for example, [System.Author](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-author)), a particular file may appear in more than one virtual folder because each folder represents one of the multiple values.

Files that don't have a value for the property that the query uses to group files are typically excluded from query results.
