## -enum-fields

### -field DefaultQuery:0

A shallow list of files in the current folder, similar to the list that File Explorer provides.

You can use this option for any storage location.

### -field OrderByName:1

A deep, flat list of files in a folder and its subfolders, sorted by [System.ItemNameDisplay](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-itemnamedisplay).

You can use this option for any storage location.

### -field OrderByTitle:2

A deep, flat list of files in a folder and its subfolders, sorted by [System.Title](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-title).

You can use this option only for folders in a library or the HomeGroup folder.

### -field OrderByMusicProperties:3

A deep, flat list of files in a folder and its subfolders, sorted by music properties.

You can use this option only for folders in a library or the HomeGroup folder.

### -field OrderBySearchRank:4

A deep, flat list of files in a folder and its subfolders, sorted by [System.Search.Rank](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-search-rank) followed by [System.DateModified](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-datemodified).

You can use this option for any storage location.

### -field OrderByDate:5

A deep, flat list of files in a folder and its subfolders, sorted by [System.ItemDate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-itemdate).

You can use this option only for folders in a library or the HomeGroup folder.

> [!NOTE]
> [System.ItemDate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-itemdate) is a computed property that changes based on the content type; for example, it maps to [System.Photo.DateTaken](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/properties/props-system-photo-datetaken) for photos.

## -remarks

Use a value from the CommonFileQuery enumeration when you call one of the following methods of the [StorageFolder](../windows.storage/storagefolder.md) class. For examples that use values from the CommonFileQuery enumeration, see the topics for these methods.

+ [CreateFileQuery(CommonFileQuery)](../windows.storage/storagefolder_createfilequery_1641434999.md)
+ [CreateFileQueryWithOptions](../windows.storage/storagefolder_createfilequerywithoptions_2038131323.md). Instantiate the [QueryOptions](queryoptions_queryoptions_1209951623.md) with the [QueryOptions(CommonFileQuery, IIterable(String))](queryoptions_queryoptions_811500193.md) constructor.
+ [CreateItemQueryWithOptions](../windows.storage/storagefolder_createitemquerywithoptions_1519361285.md). Instantiate the [QueryOptions](queryoptions_queryoptions_1209951623.md) with the [QueryOptions(CommonFileQuery, IIterable(String))](queryoptions_queryoptions_811500193.md) constructor.
+ [GetFilesAsync(CommonFileQuery)](../windows.storage/storagefolder_getfilesasync_1429382825.md)
+ [GetFilesAsync(CommonFileQuery, UInt32, UInt32)](../windows.storage/storagefolder_getfilesasync_1563132095.md)

These methods use the value from the CommonFileQuery enumeration to initialize the [FolderDepth](queryoptions_folderdepth.md), [IndexerOption](queryoptions_indexeroption.md), and [SortOrder](queryoptions_sortorder.md) options of the query.

Call the [StorageFolder.IsCommonFileQuerySupported](../windows.storage/storagefolder_iscommonfilequerysupported_1848755604.md) method to determine whether the CommonFileQuery value that you want to use is available for the current folder.

> > [!TIP]
> Files that don't have a value for the property that the query uses to sort files are typically excluded from query results.
