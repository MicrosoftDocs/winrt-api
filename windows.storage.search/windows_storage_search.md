# Windows.Storage.Search

## -description

Provides classes for enumerating content in storage and performing Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) searches on the content.

Apps can retrieve content collections in a number of shapes, including the normal folder hierarchy, flat lists, and media-oriented shapes based on item properties such as year, month, artist, album, and so on. Also, apps can add content and properties to the system index to enable fast searches of app content.

Apps can also receive events that fire when a collection changes because files were created, modified, or deleted.

For an individual item, the system exposes the stream associated with the item, a thumbnail, and item properties, and provides the ability to create and delete items.
