# Windows.Storage.Streams

## -description

Provides support for reading to and writing from sequential and random access streams.

## -remarks

A stream is an abstraction of a sequence of bytes, such as a file, I/O device, or a socket. You can perform asynchronous read, write, and seek operations on a stream.

Calling the  method on a stream flushes any buffered data and releases system resources such as file handles, sockets, and memory.
