## -description

Allows Mixed Reality applications to obtain a stream of [HolographicFrameScanoutReport](holographicframescanoutreport.md) objects.

## -remarks

This class allows Windows Mixed Reality applications to monitor detailed performance and timing information about the platform in real time. This information can be used by applications to adapt their rendering or simulation based on workload cost to ensure maximum frame rate while still achieving the best image fidelity possible. This API replaces [HolographicFramePresentationMonitor](holographicframepresentationmonitor.md) which offered similar functionality.
