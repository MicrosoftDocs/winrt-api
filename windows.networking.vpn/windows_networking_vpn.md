# Windows.Networking.Vpn

## -description
The classes in this namespace enable you to create, edit, and manage Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections, and to write plugins for controlling a VPN connection using the Windows VPN Platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use the classes in this namespace, you must declare the **networkingVpnProvider** [restricted capability](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities).

## -remarks

Enterprise VPN developers should consider their organizational licensing options. Many information technology (IT) admins will want to use disconnected (offline) licensing in order to distribute a VPN app to users even when the user does not have access to the store. See [Organizational Licensing Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/organizational-licensing) for more details.
