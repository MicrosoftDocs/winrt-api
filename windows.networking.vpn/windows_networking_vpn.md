# Windows.Networking.Vpn

## -description

The classes in this namespace enable you to create, edit, and manage virtual private network (VPN) connections, and to write plugins for controlling a VPN connection using the Windows VPN platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use the classes in this namespace, you must declare the **networkingVpnProvider** [restricted capability](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities).

## -remarks

If you're an enterprise VPN developer, then you should consider your organizational licensing options. Many information technology (IT) admins prefer disconnected (offline) licensing in order to distribute a VPN app to users even when the user doesn't have access to the Microsoft Store. See [Organizational licensing options](/windows/uwp/publish/organizational-licensing) for more details.
