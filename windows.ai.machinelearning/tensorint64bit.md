# Windows.AI.MachineLearning.TensorInt64Bit

## -description
A 64-bit signed integer tensor object.

## -remarks
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of values. A 64-bit signed integer tensor is a tensor of 64-bit signed integer values.

The layout of tensors is row-major, with tightly packed contiguous data representing each dimension. The total size of a tensor is the product of the size of each dimension.
