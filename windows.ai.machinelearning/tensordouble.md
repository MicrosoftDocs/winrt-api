# Windows.AI.MachineLearning.TensorDouble

## -description
A 64-bit float tensor object.

## -remarks
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of values. A double tensor is a tensor of 64-bit floating point values.

The layout of tensors is row-major, with tightly packed contiguous data representing each dimension. The total size of a tensor is the product of the size of each dimension.
