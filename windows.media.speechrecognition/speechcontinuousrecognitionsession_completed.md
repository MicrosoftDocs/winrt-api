# Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechContinuousRecognitionSession.Completed

## -description
Occurs when a continuous recognition session ends.

## -remarks
When an application suspends and resumes during a speech recognition session, it is important to check the [SpeechContinuousRecognitionCompletedEventArgs](speechcontinuousrecognitioncompletedeventargs.md) Status property for Success.  The API may give a UserCanceled result indicating that speech recognition needs to be restarted.
