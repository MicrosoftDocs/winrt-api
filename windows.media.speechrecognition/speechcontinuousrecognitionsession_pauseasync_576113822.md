# Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechContinuousRecognitionSession.PauseAsync

## -description
Asynchronously pause a continuous speech recognition session to update a local [grammar file](speechrecognitiongrammarfileconstraint.md) or [list constraint](speechrecognitionlistconstraint.md).

## -returns
An asynchronous handler called when the operation is complete.

## -remarks
An error is returned if [SpeechRecognizerState](speechrecognizerstate.md) is [Idle](speechrecognizerstate.md) or [Paused](speechrecognizerstate.md).

If the list of constraints is empty (which defaults to a [SpeechRecognitionTopicConstraint](speechrecognitiontopicconstraint.md)), or a [SpeechRecognitionTopicConstraint](speechrecognitiontopicconstraint.md) is present in the list of constraints, PauseAsync fails with error code COR_E_INVALIDOPERATION.
