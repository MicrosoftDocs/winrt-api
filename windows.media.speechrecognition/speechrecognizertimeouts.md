# Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognizerTimeouts

## -description
The timespan that a speech recognizer ignores silence or unrecognizable sounds (babble) and continues listening for speech input.

## -remarks
An app retrieves this object through the [SpeechRecognizer.Timeouts](speechrecognizer_timeouts.md) property.

The recognizer finalizes each operation when the specified time span elapses.

[InitialSilenceTimeout](speechrecognizertimeouts_initialsilencetimeout.md) and [EndSilenceTimeout](speechrecognizertimeouts_endsilencetimeout.md) both relate to silence, but have different uses. While [EndSilenceTimeout](speechrecognizertimeouts_endsilencetimeout.md) applies if speech input has already occurred, [InitialSilenceTimeout](speechrecognizertimeouts_initialsilencetimeout.md) applies if no speech input is received at all.
