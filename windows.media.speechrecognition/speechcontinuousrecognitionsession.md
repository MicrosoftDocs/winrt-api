# Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechContinuousRecognitionSession

## -description

Manages speech input for free-form dictation, or an arbitrary sequence of words or phrases that are defined in a local grammar file constraint.

## -remarks

An app retrieves this object through the [SpeechRecognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession](speechrecognizer_continuousrecognitionsession.md) property.

To use web-service constraints, speech input and dictation support must be enabled in **Settings** by turning on the "Get to know me" option in the Settings -> Privacy -> Speech, inking, and typing page. See "Recognize speech input" in [Speech recognition](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/speech-recognition).
