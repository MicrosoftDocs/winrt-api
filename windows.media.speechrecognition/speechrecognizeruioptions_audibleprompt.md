# Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognizerUIOptions.AudiblePrompt

## -description
Gets or sets the heading text that is displayed on the **Listening** screen. The default is "Listening...".

## -property-value
The heading text. A custom string should clearly describe the kind of info expected by the app and is limited to two lines in length.

## -remarks
The default string is automatically localized: If the speech recognizer has an associated language, the default text is shown in that language. Otherwise, the default text is shown in the system language.

You are responsible for localizing a custom string.
