# Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlaybackVideoTrackList

## -description
Represents a read-only list of [VideoTrack](../windows.media.core/videotrack.md) objects, of which a single track can be selected at one time.

## -remarks
Get an instance of this class by accessing the [VideoTracks](mediaplaybackitem_videotracks.md) property of a [MediaPlaybackItem](mediaplaybackitem.md). To be notified when the list of tracks changes, handle the [VideoTracksChanged](mediaplaybackitem_videotrackschanged.md) event.

This class provides access to the list of [VideoTrack](../windows.media.core/videotrack.md) objects that are associated with a [MediaPlaybackItem](mediaplaybackitem.md). When the media item is opened by a component and the [ItemOpened](mediaplaybacklist_itemopened.md) event is raised, you can select one of the video tracks in the track list for playback.

Note that this class does not represent a playlist of video tracks that are played sequentially. To play a sequential list of tracks, use [MediaPlaybackList](mediaplaybacklist.md).

For how-to guidance for working with the video tracks of a media item, see [Media items, playlists, and tracks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/media-playback-with-mediasource).
