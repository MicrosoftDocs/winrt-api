# Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer.GetSurface

## -description
Gets a [MediaPlayerSurface](mediaplayersurface.md) object for the [MediaPlayer](mediaplayer.md), which allows you to render the player's contents using a [Compositor](mediaplayersurface_compositor.md) without relying on the XAML framework.

## -parameters
### -param compositor
The [Compositor](../windows.ui.composition/compositor.md) with which the returned surface will be used.

## -returns
The media player surface.

## -remarks
By default, the [CompositionSurface](../windows.ui.composition/icompositionsurface.md) generated by this method will have the dimensions 640x 480, in pixels. To get a different size, call [SetSurfaceSize](mediaplayer_setsurfacesize_1529588590.md) before calling **GetSurface**.

You can obtain multiple surfaces from a single [MediaPlayer](mediaplayer.md) instance by calling **GetSurface** multiple times.

For more information on using the [Windows.UI.Composition](../windows.ui.composition/windows_ui_composition.md) APIs to render visuals, see [Visual layer](/windows/uwp/graphics/visual-layer).

For how-to guidance for rendering video to a composition surface, see [Play audio and video with MediaPlayer](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/play-audio-and-video-with-mediaplayer).
