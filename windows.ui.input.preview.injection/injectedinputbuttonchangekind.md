## -remarks

> [!Important]
> The APIs in this namespace require the inputInjectionBrokered [restricted capability](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#special-and-restricted-capabilities).

Using input injection requires the following be added to the Package.appxmanifest:

- To `<Package>`
    - `xmlns:rescap="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities"`
    - `IgnorableNamespaces="rescap"`
- To `<Capabilities>`
    - `<rescap:Capability Name="inputInjectionBrokered" />`

## -examples
