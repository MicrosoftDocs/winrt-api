## -remarks
A WebErrorStatus value is returned by [Windows.Web.WebError.GetStatus](weberror_getstatus_1856274933.md), [Windows.Networking.WebSocketError.GetStatus](../windows.networking.sockets/websocketerror_getstatus_1856274933.md), and [Windows.Networking.BackgroundTransfer.GetStatus](../windows.networking.backgroundtransfer/backgroundtransfererror_getstatus_1856274933.md).

This example demonstrates how to use WebErrorStatus to display a different error message depending on the type of error. In this example, the WebErrorStatus value is returned by [Windows.Networking.WebSocketError.GetStatus](../windows.networking.sockets/websocketerror_getstatus_1856274933.md).

```csharp
using Windows.Web;
using Windows.Networking.Sockets;

// Pointer back to the main page. Needed to call methods in MainPage such as NotifyUser()
MainPage rootPage = MainPage.Current;

WebErrorStatus status = WebSocketError.GetStatus(ex.GetBaseException().HResult);

if (status == WebErrorStatus.CannotConnect ||
    status == WebErrorStatus.NotFound || 
    status == WebErrorStatus.RequestTimeout)
{
    rootPage.NotifyUser("Cannot connect to the server", NotifyType.ErrorMessage);
}
else
{
    rootPage.NotifyUser("Error: " + status, NotifyType.ErrorMessage);
}
```

```cppwinrt
// Pointer back to the main page. Needed to call methods in MainPage such as NotifyUser().
m_rootPage = MainPage::Current();

Windows::Web::WebErrorStatus status{ Windows::Networking::Sockets::WebSocketError::GetStatus(exception.to_abi()) };

if (status == Windows::Web::WebErrorStatus::CannotConnect ||
    status == Windows::Web::WebErrorStatus::NotFound ||
    status == Windows::Web::WebErrorStatus::RequestTimeout)
{
    m_rootPage.NotifyUser(L"Cannot connect to the server", NotifyType::ErrorMessage);
}
else
{
    m_rootPage.NotifyUser(std::wstring(L"Error: ") + exception.message().c_str(), NotifyType::ErrorMessage);
}
```

```cppcx
using namespace Windows::Web;
using namespace Windows::Networking::Sockets;

// Pointer back to the main page. Needed to call methods in MainPage such as NotifyUser()
rootPage = MainPage::Current;

WebErrorStatus status = WebSocketError::GetStatus(exception->HResult);

if (status == WebErrorStatus::CannotConnect || 
    status == WebErrorStatus::NotFound || 
    status == WebErrorStatus::RequestTimeout)
{
    rootPage->NotifyUser("Cannot connect to the server", NotifyType::ErrorMessage);
}
else
{
    rootPage->NotifyUser("Error: " + status.ToString(), NotifyType::ErrorMessage);
}
```

```javascript
var errorStatus = Windows.Networking.Sockets.WebSocketError.getStatus(error.number);
if (errorStatus === Windows.Web.WebErrorStatus.cannotConnect ||
    errorStatus === Windows.Web.WebErrorStatus.notFound ||
    errorStatus === Windows.Web.WebErrorStatus.requestTimeout) {
    WinJS.log && WinJS.log("Cannot connect to the server");
}
else {
    WinJS.log && WinJS.log("Failed to connect: " + getError(error));
}
```
