# Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechAppendedSilence

## -description
Specifies the amount of silence added to the end of the speech synthesis utterance (before another utterance begins).

## -enum-fields
### -field Min:1
The minimum amount of silence defined by the speech synthesis voice.

### -field Default:0
The default amount of silence defined by the speech synthesis voice.

## -remarks
By default, approximately 750ms of silence is appended to the end of each generated utterance. If the utterance is not a complete sentence, this can complicate concatenation of multiple utterances. For example, a streaming app that reads text from a document as it downloads, might start reading from its cache at a predetermined number of words.
