# Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer

## -description

Provides access to the functionality of an installed speech synthesis engine (voice) for Text-to-speech (TTS) services.

## -remarks

Only Microsoft-signed voices installed on the system can be used to generate speech.

Windows includes various Microsoft-signed voices that can be used for a number of languages. Each voice generates synthesized speech in a single language, as spoken in a specific country/region.

By default, a new SpeechSynthesizer object uses the current system voice (call [DefaultVoice](speechsynthesizer_defaultvoice.md) to find out what the default voice is).

To specify any of the other speech synthesis (text-to-speech) voices installed on the user's system, use the [Voice](speechsynthesizer_voice.md) method (to find out which [voices](voiceinformation.md) are installed on the system, call [AllVoices](speechsynthesizer_allvoices.md)).

If you don't specify a language, the voice that most closely corresponds to the language selected in the Language control panel is loaded.

Use a SpeechSynthesizer object to:

- Generate speech from plain text using [SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync](speechsynthesizer_synthesizetexttostreamasync_2010301348.md), or [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/) using [SynthesizeSsmlToStreamAsync](speechsynthesizer_synthesizessmltostreamasync_1873155127.md) (
- The generated audio stream is played through a [MediaElement](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/mediaelement.md) object), which lets you manage all media playback.
- Control the speech output with the various [SpeechSynthesizerOptions](speechsynthesizeroptions.md) settings exposed through [SpeechSynthesizer.Options](speechsynthesizer_options.md).

## -examples

The following example shows how to generate a speech audio stream from a basic text string.

```javascript
// The object for controlling and playing audio.
var audio = new Audio();

// The object for controlling the speech synthesis engine (voice).
var synth = new Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer();

// Generate the audio stream from plain text.
synth.synthesizeTextToStreamAsync("hello World").then(function (markersStream) {

    // Convert the stream to a URL Blob.
    var blob = MSApp.createBlobFromRandomAccessStream(markersStream.ContentType, markersStream);

    // Send the Blob to the audio object.
    audio.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob, { oneTimeOnly: true });
    audio.play();
});
```

```csharp
// The media object for controlling and playing audio.
MediaElement mediaElement = this.media;

// The object for controlling the speech synthesis engine (voice).
var synth = new Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer();

// Generate the audio stream from plain text.
SpeechSynthesisStream stream = await synth.SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync("Hello World");

// Send the stream to the media object.
mediaElement.SetSource(stream, stream.ContentType);
mediaElement.Play();
```

This example shows how to generate a speech audio stream from an SSML string, which includes some modulation elements that control the pitch, speaking rate, and volume of the speech output.

```javascript
// The string to speak with SSML customizations.
var Ssml = "<speak version='1.0' " +
    "xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis' xml:lang='en-US'>" +
    "Hello <prosody contour='(0%,+80Hz) (10%,+80%) (40%,+80Hz)'>World</prosody> " + 
    "<break time='500ms'/>" +
    "Goodbye <prosody rate='slow' contour='(0%,+20Hz) (10%,+30%) (40%,+10Hz)'>World</prosody>" +
    "</speak>";

// The object for controlling and playing audio.
var audio = new Audio();

// The object for controlling the speech synthesis engine (voice).
var synth = new Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer();

// Generate the audio stream from plain text.
synth.synthesizeSsmlToStreamAsync(Ssml).then(function(synthesisStream){

    // Convert the stream to a URL Blob.
    var blob = MSApp.createBlobFromRandomAccessStream(synthesisStream.ContentType, synthesisStream);

    // Send the Blob to the audio object.
    audio.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob, { oneTimeOnly: true });
    audio.play();
});
```

```csharp
// The string to speak with SSML customizations.
string Ssml =
    @"<speak version='1.0' " +
    "xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis' xml:lang='en-US'>" +
    "Hello <prosody contour='(0%,+80Hz) (10%,+80%) (40%,+80Hz)'>World</prosody> " + 
    "<break time='500ms'/>" +
    "Goodbye <prosody rate='slow' contour='(0%,+20Hz) (10%,+30%) (40%,+10Hz)'>World</prosody>" +
    "</speak>";

// The media object for controlling and playing audio.
MediaElement mediaElement = this.media;

// The object for controlling the speech synthesis engine (voice).
var synth = new Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis.SpeechSynthesizer();

// Generate the audio stream from plain text.
SpeechSynthesisStream stream = await synth.synthesizeSsmlToStreamAsync(Ssml);

// Send the stream to the media object.
mediaElement.SetSource(stream, stream.ContentType);
mediaElement.Play();
```
