# Windows.System.Profile.WindowsIntegrityPolicy

## -description
Provides information about the current Windows 10 secure mode (10 S mode), and an event that is raised when the mode changes.

## -remarks
Windows provides 10 S (also known as Windows Lockdown) as a mode. When Windows is in 10 S mode, only Microsoft components and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps can run. Certain specific components, such as `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`, are also disallowed. UWP apps, particularly security and firewall apps, need to be aware of the current 10 S mode in order to behave properly. Such apps also need to be notified when 10 S mode transitions from enabled to disabled.
