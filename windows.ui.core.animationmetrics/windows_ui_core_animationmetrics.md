# Windows.UI.Core.AnimationMetrics

## -description

The classes and their properties that are exposed through this namespace retrieve the raw scaling, translation, and opacity parameters used in Windows animations
. These parameters include such metrics as the animation type, stagger delay, z-order, duration, initial and final opacity, initial and final scale factors, and cubic Bezier control points, among others. This information enables developers of apps and application frameworks to create custom animations that are consistent with both Windows itself and with other apps that use Windows animations.
