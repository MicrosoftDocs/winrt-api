# Windows.ApplicationModel.ConversationalAgent.ConversationalAgentSession

## -description

The communication channel between the digital assistant and the Windows Conversational Agent platform.

## -remarks

The ConversationalAgentSession is typically created through voice activation when a keyword utterance such as "Hey Cortana" or "Alexa" is recognized.

A ConversationalAgentSession can be created in various other ways, including Bluetooth (when a keyword utterance is transmitted through a headset or microphone), system keyboard accelerators (such as Win+C for Cortana), and initiation of speech interactions from within your app (perhaps through some kind of press-to-talk UI).
