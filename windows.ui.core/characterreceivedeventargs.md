# Windows.UI.Core.CharacterReceivedEventArgs

## -description
Provides the arguments returned by the event raised when a character is received by the input queue.

## -remarks

> **WindowsÂ 10**
> Apps do not receive this event when an [Input Method Editor (IME)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh967427(v=win.10)) is enabled. The Input Method Editor (IME) handles all keyboard input and sets [Handled](acceleratorkeyeventargs_handled.md) to **true**.

> **Windows Phone**
> This API is supported in native apps only.

This object is returned by a delegate registered for the following event:
+ [CoreWindow.CharacterReceived](corewindow_characterreceived.md)

```cppwinrt
void SetWindow(CoreWindow const& window)
{
    ...
    window.CharacterReceived({this, &App::OnCharacterReceived });
}

// Character received event data in CharacterReceivedEventArgs.
void OnCharacterReceived(
    Windows::UI::Core::CoreWindow const& /* sender */,
    Windows::UI::Core::CharacterReceivedEventArgs const& /* args */)
{
}
```

```cppcx
// returning character received events data through CharacterReceivedEventArgs

void MyCoreWindowEvents::SetWindow( // implementation called by CoreApplication::Run(), provided for context
    _In_ CoreWindow^ window
    )
{
    // ...
    window->CharacterReceived +=
        ref new TypedEventHandler<CoreWindow^, CharacterReceivedEventArgs^>(this, &CoreWindowEvents::OnCharacterReceived);
    // ...
}
```
