# Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow.PointerCursor

## -description

Gets or sets the pointer cursor used by the app.

## -property-value

The pointer cursor used by the app.

## -remarks

Some applications, such as games, need to track relative mouse movements for specific functionality (for example, a virtual trackball or the viewing camera) and don't use the system cursor or absolute screen coordinates. For details on hiding the mouse cursor and ignoring absolute mouse data, see [Relative mouse movement and CoreWindow](/windows/uwp/gaming/relative-mouse-movement).
