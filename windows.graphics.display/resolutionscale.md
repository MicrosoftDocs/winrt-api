## -remarks
For more info on scaling to pixel density, see [UX guidelines for layout and scaling](/windows/uwp/design/layout/screen-sizes-and-breakpoints-for-responsive-design).

The [Scaling according to DPI sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Scaling%20according%20to%20DPI%20sample) shows how to use the ResolutionScale enumeration.

For UWP apps and Windows Phone apps, we recommend these scale factors:

+ UWP app (100/140/180)
+ Windows Phone apps for Windows Phone 8.1 and later (100/140/240)
+ Windows Phone apps for Windows Phone 8 (100/150/160)
