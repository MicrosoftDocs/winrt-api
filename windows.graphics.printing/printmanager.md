# Windows.Graphics.Printing.PrintManager

## -description
Provides the entry-point for printing within an application.

## -remarks
The PrintManager class is responsible for orchestrating the printing flow for UWP app. To use this class, you must first call the [GetForCurrentView](printmanager_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) method. This method returns the PrintManager object that is specific to the current active window. Next, you must add an event listener for the [PrintTaskRequested](printmanager_printtaskrequested.md) event. This event is raised when the application invokes the printing dialog via the **ShowPrintUIAsync** method.

When a UWP app registers its "intention" to print, it creates a print contract with the print manager. Here is a JavaScript code snippet to show how to register your app for a print contract using a PrintManager:

```javascript
    var app = WinJS.Application;

    // This function responds to all application activations.
    app.onactivated = function (eventObject) {
        if (eventObject.detail.kind === Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.ActivationKind.launch) {
           
            //Register for print contract
            var printManager = Windows.Graphics.Printing.PrintManager.getForCurrentView();
            printManager.onprinttaskrequested = onPrintTaskRequested;
        
            WinJS.UI.processAll();
        }
    };

```
