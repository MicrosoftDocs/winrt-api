# Windows.Media.Devices.VideoDeviceController

## -description

Controls device settings on the camera.
<!--Note: In the method descriptions, I took the units from the documentation for PROPSETID_VIDCAP_VIDEOPROCAMP and PROPSETID_VIDCAP_CAMERACONTROL. As far as I can tell, the WinRT layer does no conversion of the values.-->

## -remarks

To get an instance of this object, retrieve the [MediaCapture.VideoDeviceController](../windows.media.capture/mediacapture_videodevicecontroller.md) property.

Some drivers may require that the camera device preview to be in a running state before it can determine which controls are supported by the [VideoDeviceController](../windows.media.capture/mediacapture_videodevicecontroller.md). If you check whether a certain control is supported by the [VideoDeviceController](../windows.media.capture/mediacapture_videodevicecontroller.md) before the preview stream is running, the control may be described as unsupported even though it is supported by the video device.
