# Windows.Media.Devices.VideoTemporalDenoisingControl

## -description
When supported, allows an app to enable temporal denoising for video capture.

## -remarks
Temporal denoising can improve the visual quality of video to the human eye, but it also can reduce image consistency and details which can negatively impact the performance of registration, optical character recognition, and other computer vision tasks. This control allows you to enable and disable the feature depending on your app's current video capture scenario.
