## -property-value
A list of the advanced capture modes supported by the current capture device.

## -remarks
> [!NOTE] 
> Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, recording video and using AdvancedPhotoCapture concurrently is supported.  This is not supported in previous versions. This change means that you can have a prepared **[LowLagMediaRecording](/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.lowlagmediarecording)** and **[AdvancedPhotoCapture](/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.advancedphotocapture)** at the same time. You can start or stop video recording between calls to **[MediaCapture.PrepareAdvancedPhotoCaptureAsync](/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacapture#Windows_Media_Capture_MediaCapture_PrepareAdvancedPhotoCaptureAsync_Windows_Media_MediaProperties_ImageEncodingProperties_)** and **[AdvancedPhotoCapture.FinishAsync](/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.advancedphotocapture.FinishAsync)**. You can also call **[AdvancedPhotoCapture.CaptureAsync](/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.advancedphotocapture.CaptureAsync)** while video is recording. However, some **AdvancedPhotoCapture** scenarios, like capturing an HDR photo while recording video would cause some video frames to be altered by the HDR capture, resulting in a negative user experience. For this reason, the list of modes returned by the **[AdvancedPhotoControl.SupportedModes](/uwp/api/windows.media.devices.advancedphotocontrol.SupportedModes)** will be different while video is recording. You should check this value immediately after starting or stopping video recording to ensure that the desired mode is supported in the current video recording state.
