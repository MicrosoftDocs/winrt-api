### -field Continue:100
The client should continue with its request.

### -field SwitchingProtocols:101
The HTTP protocol version or protocol is being changed.

### -field Processing:102
The server has received a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) request and is processing the request.

This status code is an HTTP extension used with WebDAV. It can only be returned if the client HTTP request included the DAV header in the request. This status code is documented in IETF [RFC 2518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518).

### -field Ok:200
The request succeeded and that the requested information is in the response. This is the most common status code to receive.

### -field Created:201
The request resulted in a new resource created before the response was sent.

### -field Accepted:202
The request has been accepted for further processing.

### -field NonAuthoritativeInformation:203
The returned meta-information is from a cached copy instead of the origin server and therefore may be incorrect.

### -field NoContent:204
The request has been successfully processed and that the response is intentionally blank.

### -field ResetContent:205
The client should reset (not reload) the current resource.

### -field PartialContent:206
The response is a partial response as requested by a **GET** request that includes a byte range.

### -field MultiStatus:207
The response provides status for multiple independent operations. Specific error messages appear in the body of the multi- status response.

This status code is an HTTP extension used with Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV). This status code is documented in IETF [RFC 4918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918).

### -field AlreadyReported:208
Some of the results of the requested operation were already reported.

This status code is an HTTP extension used with Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV). It can only be returned if the client HTTP request included the DAV header in the request. This status code is documented in IETF [RFC 5842](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842).

### -field IMUsed:226

This status code is documented in IETF [RFC 3229](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229).

### -field MultipleChoices:300
The requested information has multiple representations. The default action is to treat this status as a redirect and follow the contents of the **Location** header associated with this response.

### -field Found:302
The requested information is located at the URI specified in the **Location** header. The default action when this status is received is to follow the **Location** header associated with the response. When the original request method was **POST**, the redirected request will use the **GET** method.

### -field SeeOther:303
Automatically redirects the client to the URI specified in the **Location** header as the result of a **POST**. The request to the resource specified by the **Location** header will be made with the **GET** method.

### -field NotModified:304
The client's cached copy is up to date. The contents of the resource are not transferred.

### -field UseProxy:305
The request should use the proxy server at the URI specified in the **Location** header.

### -field TemporaryRedirect:307
The request information is located at the URI specified in the **Location** header. The default action when this status is received is to follow the **Location** header associated with the response. When the original request method was **POST**, the redirected request will also use the **POST** method.

### -field PermanentRedirect:308
The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs specified in the **Location** header.

This status code is documented in IETF draft [draft-reschke-http-status-308](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-reschke-http-status-308-07).

### -field ExpectationFailed:417
An expectation given in an **Expect** header could not be met by the server.

### -field UnprocessableEntity:422

## -remarks
The HttpStatusCode enumeration contains the values of the status codes defined by the IETF in [RFC 2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) for HTTP 1.1 and related RFCs.

The status of an HTTP request is contained in the [StatusCode](httpresponsemessage_statuscode.md) property on the [HttpResponseMessage](httpresponsemessage.md) object.
