# Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient.GetAsync

## -description
Send a GET request to the specified [Uri](../windows.foundation/uri.md) with an HTTP completion option as an asynchronous operation. For programming guidance for the [HttpClient class](/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpclient), and code examples, see the [HttpClient](/windows/uwp/networking/httpclient) conceptual topic.

## -parameters
### -param uri
The [Uri](../windows.foundation/uri.md) the request is sent to.

### -param completionOption
An HTTP completion option value that indicates when the operation should be considered completed.

## -returns
The object representing the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
This operation will not block. The returned [IAsyncOperationWithProgress](../windows.foundation/iasyncoperationwithprogress_2.md) (of [HttpResponseMessage](/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpresponsemessage) and [HttpProgress](/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpprogress)) completes based on the *completionOption* parameter after part or all of the response (including content) is read.

Below are the exceptions that this content throws.

### COMException

Thrown when a feature-specific **HRESULT** is returned from a method call.

This is the most common exception that is thrown by networking methods. An app should use the **HRESULT** from the exception to determine the cause of the error.

### AccessDeniedException

Thrown when access is denied to a resource or feature. This exception occurs when an app doesn't have the required network capabilities set in the app manifest for the network operation requested.

### InvalidArgumentException

Thrown when one of the arguments that are provided to a method is not valid.

If user-supplied input caused this exception, an app could inform the user and request new input.

### ObjectDisposedException

Thrown when an operation is performed on a disposed object.

### OutOfMemoryException

Thrown when insufficient memory is available to complete the operation.
