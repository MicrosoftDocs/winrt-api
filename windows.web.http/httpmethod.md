# Windows.Web.Http.HttpMethod

## -description
Retrieves standard HTTP methods such as GET and POST and creates new HTTP methods.

## -remarks
The most common use of [HttpMethod](httpmethod.md) is to get a standard HTTP method (verb) from a property on this class. However, if an app needs a different value for the HTTP method, the [HttpMethod](httpmethod_httpmethod.md) constructor initializes a new instance of the [HttpMethod](httpmethod.md) with an HTTP method that the app developer specifies.
