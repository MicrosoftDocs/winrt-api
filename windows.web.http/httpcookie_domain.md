# Windows.Web.Http.HttpCookie.Domain

## -description
Get the domain for which the [HttpCookie](httpcookie.md) is valid.

## -property-value
The domain for which the [HttpCookie](httpcookie.md) is valid.

## -remarks
The Domain property specifies those hosts to which the cookie will be sent.

A cookie with a Domain property of *.contoso.com* will be sent to the *contoso.com* domain and all subdomains (`www.contoso.com` and *info.contoso.com*, for example).

A cookie with a Domain property of *info.contoso.com* will not be sent to *contoso.com* or `www.contoso.com`, but will be sent to *info.contoso.com* and all subdomains (*uk.info.contoso.com* and *us.info.contoso.com*, for example).

The default value for the Domain property is the host name that this cookie was received from.
