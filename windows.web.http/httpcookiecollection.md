# Windows.Web.Http.HttpCookieCollection

## -description
Provides a collection container for instances of the [HttpCookie](httpcookie.md) class.

## -remarks
The [GetCookies](httpcookiemanager_getcookies_1465382103.md) method on [HttpCookieManager](httpcookiemanager.md) returns an [HttpCookieCollection](httpcookiecollection.md) object. This is the method that an [HttpCookieCollection](httpcookiecollection.md) is constructed.

### Enumerating the collection in C# or Microsoft Visual Basic

[HttpCookieCollection](httpcookiecollection.md) is enumerable, so you can use language-specific syntax such as **foreach** in C# to enumerate the items in the collection. The compiler does the type-casting for you and you won't need to cast to `IEnumerable<HttpCookie>` explicitly. If you do need to cast explicitly, for example if you want to call [GetEnumerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable.getenumerator), cast to [IEnumerable<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1) with an [HttpCookie](httpcookie.md) constraint.
