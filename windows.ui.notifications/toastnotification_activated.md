# Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotification.Activated

## -description
Occurs when user activates a toast notification through a click or touch. Apps that are running subscribe to this event.

## -remarks
In the case of toast raised by a desktop app, that app must subscribe to at least the Activated event so that it can handle the expected activation of the app from the toast when the user selects it.
