# Windows.Devices.Input.MouseEventArgs

## -description
Contains event data for the [MouseMoved](mousedevice_mousemoved.md) event.

## -remarks
**JavaScript:** This object is accessed when you implement a handler to respond to [MouseMoved](mousedevice_mousemoved.md) events.

The [Device Capabilities Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231530) demonstrates how to detect the presence of input devices and retrieve the capabilities and attributes of each device.

> [!NOTE]
> : This class is not agile, which means that you need to consider its threading model and marshaling behavior. For more info, see [Threading and Marshaling (C++/CX)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258275) and [Using Windows Runtime objects in a multithreaded environment (.NET)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258277).
