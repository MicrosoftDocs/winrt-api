# Windows.Devices.Input.MouseCapabilities

## -description

Supports the ability to determine the capabilities of any connected mouse devices.

## -remarks

The values returned by the properties discussed here are based on the total number of mice connected: Boolean properties return true if one mouse supports a specific capability and numeric properties return the maximum value exposed by all mice.

The [Device Capabilities Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231530) demonstrates how to detect the presence of input devices and retrieve the capabilities and attributes of each device.
