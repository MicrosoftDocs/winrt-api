# Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.DataTransferManager

## -description
Programmatically initiates an exchange of content with other apps.

## -remarks
The **DataTransferManager** class is a static class that you use to initiate sharing operations. To use the class, first call the [GetForCurrentView](datatransfermanager_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) method. This method returns the **DataTransferManager** object that is specific to the active window. Next, you need to add an event listener for the [datarequested](datatransfermanager_datarequested.md) event to the object. This event is fired when a sharing operation starts— typically when the user taps the Share charm, although it is also fired if your app starts a share operation programmatically.

The **DataTransferManager** class includes a [ShowShareUI](datatransfermanager_showshareui_1578854276.md) method, which you can use to programmatically start a share operation.

The **DataTransferManager** class also has a [TargetApplicationChosen](datatransfermanager_targetapplicationchosen.md) event. Use this event when you want to capture what applications a user selects when sharing content from your app.

> This class is not agile, which means that you need to consider its threading model and marshaling behavior.
