# Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.DataTransferManager.TargetApplicationChosen

## -description
Occurs when the user chooses a target app in the Share UI.

## -remarks
When the user chooses a target app to share content with, the system fires a **TargetApplicationChosen** event. The app receiving the event can use this event to record information about the target app for business intelligence. A common use of this event is to record which applications are used to complete different sharing actions, which in turn can help the source app create better experiences for the user.
