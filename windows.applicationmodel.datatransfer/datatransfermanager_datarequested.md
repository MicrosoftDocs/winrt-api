# Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.DataTransferManager.DataRequested

## -description
Occurs when a share operation starts.

## -remarks
This event is fired when your app starts a share operation programmatically. To handle this event, you need to add an event listener to the [DataTransferManager](datatransfermanager.md) object for the active window. You can get this object through the [GetForCurrentView](datatransfermanager_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) method.

When handling a **datarequested** event, the most important property you need to be aware of is its [request](datarequestedeventargs_request.md) property. This property contains a [DataRequest](datarequest.md) object. Your app uses this object to provide the data that the user wants to share with a selected target app.



## -examples
This example uses an inline function to handle a **datarequested** event.
