# Windows.ApplicationModel.CommunicationBlocking.CommunicationBlockingAppManager.ShowCommunicationBlockingSettingsUI

## -description
Displays the UI to select the currently active blocking application.

## -remarks
Multiple call blocking applications can be installed on a single device. However, only one of these apps can be active at a time. The only way to switch the currently active app is to call [ShowCommunicationBlockingSettingsUI](communicationblockingappmanager_showcommunicationblockingsettingsui_684721843.md) and let the user select which app should be active.
