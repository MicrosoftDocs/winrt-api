# Windows.ApplicationModel.CommunicationBlocking.CommunicationBlockingAppManager

## -description

Determines the application to use as a blocking application.

## -remarks

A user can install multiple applications that are capable of filtering messages and calls. However, only one of these blocking applications can be active at a time. This class is used to determine the active blocking application.

When an application is selected to be the active call blocking app, it will be notified by [CommunicationBlockingAppSetAsActiveTrigger](../windows.applicationmodel.background/communicationblockingappsetasactivetrigger.md)
