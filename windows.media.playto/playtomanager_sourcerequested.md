# Windows.Media.PlayTo.PlayToManager.SourceRequested

## -description
Occurs when a user requests media to stream to a Play To target device.

## -remarks
The **SourceRequested** event is fired when a user selects the **Devices** charm in a Play Toâ€“ enabled application. You supply the audio, video, or image that Play To will stream to a target device during the **SourceRequested** event.

If you do not supply a media source within 200 milliseconds, the **SourceRequested** event will time out and the Devices charm will not display any Play To targets for your app.

The **SourceRequested** event occurs before the user selects the target device. After the user has selected the target device, the [SourceSelected](playtomanager_sourceselected.md) event is fired. If the user exits the **Devices** charm without selecting a target device, the [SourceSelected](playtomanager_sourceselected.md) event isn't fired.
