# Windows.Media.ContentRestrictions

## -description
Provides classes that define Family Safety settings for a Windows user.

Content provider apps have content that may be inappropriate for young children. The Family Safety Content API allows these apps to discover Family Safety settings for a Windows user, and creates safe and appropriate experiences for children.

Content restriction settings are divided into two categories–*content browsing* and *content consumption*. The content browsing age settings control, which content is presented to a user in an app’s content catalog (for example, Microsoft Store ’s app list, a movie app’s movie/TV list). This shields children from content with unsafe thumbnail pictures or descriptions, like adult movies.

Content consumption settings define whether a specific piece of content can be consumed (for example, whether an app can be installed, or a movie can be watched). If content is blocked for consumption, the child is given an option to ask for a parental override.

Apps specify the minimum level of Family Safety content restrictions to be enforced, for both browsing and consumption of content for user's interactions with the app.
