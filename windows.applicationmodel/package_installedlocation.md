## -description

Gets the current package's path in the original install folder for the current package.

## -property-value

The current package's path in the original install folder for the current package.

## -remarks

There are several other ways to refer to a file in a package.


+ You can just begin a URI with a "/" to refer to the package root. For example: `<img src="/file.png" alt="" />`
+ You can use the "ms-appx:///" protocol. For example:`<img src="ms-appx://packageFullName/file.png" alt="" />`
+ You can also omit the package name to let the system fill in the domain, as shown here:

`<img src="ms-appx:///file.png" alt="" />`
For more info about how to refer to files in an app's package, see [URI schemes](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-resources/uri-schemes) and [Reference an image or other asset from XAML markup and code](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-resources/images-tailored-for-scale-theme-contrast#reference-an-image-or-other-asset-from-xaml-markup-and-code).
