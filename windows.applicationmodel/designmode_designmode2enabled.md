# Windows.ApplicationModel.DesignMode.DesignMode2Enabled

## -description
Used to enable or disable user code inside a XAML designer that targets the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update SDK, or later.

## -property-value
**True** if called from code running inside a XAML designer that targets the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, or later; otherwise **false**.

## -remarks
[Windows.ApplicationModel.DesignMode.DesignModeEnabled](designmode_designmodeenabled.md) returns **true** when called from user code running inside any version of the XAML designer--regardless of which SDK version you target. This check is recommended for most users.

Starting with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Visual Studio provides a new XAML designer that targets the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later.  

Use **Windows.ApplicationModel.DesignMode.DesignMode2Enabled** to differentiate code that depends on functionality only enabled for a XAML designer that targets the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update SDK or later.

The following table lists differences in functionality supported by the XAML designer, depending on the version of the Windows 10 SDK that the XAML designer targets.

|           | XAML designer that targets the Windows 10 Creators Update SDK or earlier  | Xaml designer that targets the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update SDK or later |
