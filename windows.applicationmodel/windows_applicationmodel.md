# Windows.ApplicationModel

## -description
Provides an app with access to core system functionality and run-time information about its app package, and handles suspend operations.

## -remarks
To improve system responsiveness, apps are given low priority access to resources after they are suspended. To support this new priority, the suspend operation timeout is extended so that the app has the equivalent of the 5-second timeout for normal priority. You cannot extend or alter this timeout window.
