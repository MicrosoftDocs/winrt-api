# Windows.ApplicationModel.StartupTask

## -description
Represents a UWP app or a desktop application background task that runs at system startup or when the user logs in to their device.

## -remarks
This functionality is supported on desktop versions of Windows in both UWP apps and desktop applications in a Windows app package. For more information on packaged desktop applications (also known as Desktop Bridge Apps), see [Package desktop applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-root). Support for packaged desktop applications was introduced in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (version 1607), and for UWP apps in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709).

An app must add the `windows.startup` extension category to its app package manifest in order to be activated at startup or when the user logs in. Adding this extension will not, by itself, automatically cause the app start.

UWP apps must call [RequestEnableAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.StartupTask.RequestEnableAsync) from a UI thread to trigger a user-consent dialog. If the user consents, the UWP app will then start on startup or user log in. Note that UWP startup apps will start minimized.

If **RequestEnableAsync** is called from a packaged desktop app, no user-consent dialog is shown. Desktop apps can set their startup tasks to **Enabled** in the manifest, in which case they do not need to call [RequestEnableAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.StartupTask.RequestEnableAsync).

In both cases, the app must be launched by the user at least once for startup functionality to be enabled. Once enabled, the user is in control and can change the enabled state of your app at any time via the **Startup** tab in Task Manager.

The following extension declaration goes in the app package manifest. The declaration that you use depends on whether your startup task will be a UWP app or desktop app background task.

### Packaged desktop app startup task extension

```xml
<Package xmlns:uap5="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/5"...>
...
<Applications>
    <Application ...>
        ...
        <Extensions>
          <uap5:Extension
            Category="windows.startupTask"
            Executable="MyDesktopApp.exe"
            EntryPoint="Windows.FullTrustApplication">
            <uap5:StartupTask
              TaskId="MyStartupId"
              Enabled="false"
              DisplayName="My Desktop App" />
          </uap5:Extension>
        </Extensions>
    </Application>
</Applications>
```

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|**xmlns:uap5** | Specifies the general UAP contract version 5 namespace.<br></br>Note: for the Fall Creators update (Windows version 1703) use the Windows Desktop specific XML namespace instead, `xmlns:desktop="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/desktop/windows10",` and replace occurrences of `uap5:` with `desktop:` in the example above. |
|**Category** | Must have the value `"windows.startupTask"`.|
|**Executable** | The relative path to the .exe to start.|
|**EntryPoint** | Must have the value `"Windows.FullTrustApplication"`.|
|**TaskId** | A unique identifier for your task. Using this identifier, your app can call the APIs in this class to programmatically enable or disable a startup task.
|**Enabled** | May be set to `true` for packaged desktop apps to indicate that the app is enabled for startup without first needing to call [RequestEnableAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.StartupTask.RequestEnableAsync).|
|**DisplayName** | The name of the task that appears in Task Manager.|

For packaged desktop apps, multiple **startupTask** extensions are permitted, and each one can specify a different executable.

### UWP app startup task extension

```xml
<Package xmlns:uap5="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/5" ...>
...
<Applications>
    <Application ...>
        ...
        <Extensions>
          <uap5:Extension Category="windows.startupTask">
            <uap5:StartupTask
              TaskId="MyStartupId"
              Enabled="false"
              DisplayName="Test startup" />
          </uap5:Extension>
      </Extensions>
    </Application>
</Applications>
```

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|**xmlns:uap5** | UWP apps use the general UAP contract version 5 namespace. |
|**Category** | Must have the value `"windows.startupTask"` |
|**TaskId** | The unique identifier for your task. Using this identifier, your app can call the APIs in this class to programmatically enable or disable a startup task. |
|**Enabled** | For UWP apps, this attribute is ignored and the feature is implicitly disabled until the user first launches the app and the user confirms the app's request to enable activation at startup. |
|**DisplayName** | The name of the UWP app that appears in Task Manager. |
|**Executable** | Ignored. If provided, it cannot be empty or null. The app this Package.appxmanifest file belongs to is the implied executable.  |
|**EntryPoint** | Ignored. If provided, it cannot be empty or null. The entry point is implied. |

UWP apps should only have one **Executable** entry and **windows.startupTask** extension.  
The **windows.startupTask** extension is only available for UWP apps that run on Windows Desktop.

### Windows Web App (WWA) startup task extension

```xml
<Package xmlns:uap5="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10/5" .m..>
...
<Applications>
    <Application ...>
        ...
        <Extensions>
          <uap5:Extension Category="windows.startupTask" StartPage="EntryPage">
            <uap5:StartupTask
              TaskId="MyStartupId"
              DisplayName="Test startup"/>
          </uap5:Extension>
      </Extensions>
    </Application>
</Applications>
```

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|**xmlns:uap5** | UWP apps use the general UAP contract version 5 namespace. |
|**StartPage** | The name of the page to display when the WWA starts. |
|**Category** | Must have the value `"windows.startupTask"` |
|**TaskId** | The unique identifier for your task. Using this identifier, your app can call the APIs in this class to programmatically enable or disable a startup task. |
|**DisplayName** | The name of the UWP app that appears in Task Manager. |

For WWA apps, **Executable**, **EntryPoint**, and **Enables** are ignored and may be either missing or null.

## Example

The following code creates a **StartupTask**:

```cs
StartupTask startupTask = await StartupTask.GetAsync("MyStartupId"); // Pass the task ID you specified in the appxmanifest file
switch (startupTask.State)
{
    case StartupTaskState.Disabled:
        // Task is disabled but can be enabled.
        StartupTaskState newState = await startupTask.RequestEnableAsync(); // ensure that you are on a UI thread when you call RequestEnableAsync()
        Debug.WriteLine("Request to enable startup, result = {0}", newState);
        break;
    case StartupTaskState.DisabledByUser:
        // Task is disabled and user must enable it manually.
        MessageDialog dialog = new MessageDialog(
            "You have disabled this app's ability to run " +
            "as soon as you sign in, but if you change your mind, " +
            "you can enable this in the Startup tab in Task Manager.",
            "TestStartup");
        await dialog.ShowAsync();
        break;
    case StartupTaskState.DisabledByPolicy:
        Debug.WriteLine("Startup disabled by group policy, or not supported on this device");
        break;
    case StartupTaskState.Enabled:
        Debug.WriteLine("Startup is enabled.");
        break;
}
```
