# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging.WriteableBitmap

## -description

Provides a [BitmapSource](bitmapsource.md) that can be written to and updated.

## -remarks

The image source data of a WriteableBitmap is an underlying pixel buffer.

The [IBuffer](/uwp/api/windows.storage.streams.ibuffer) returned by [WriteableBitmap.PixelBuffer](writeablebitmap_pixelbuffer.md) can't be written to directly. But you can use language-specific techniques to write to the underlying pixel content in the buffer. For details, see the **Remarks** section of [WriteableBitmap.PixelBuffer](writeablebitmap_pixelbuffer.md).

Some of the scenarios where you might have used a **WriteableBitmap** class in previous XAML frameworks can be accomplished in the Windows Runtime by using the [RenderTargetBitmap](rendertargetbitmap.md) class instead. For more info see [RenderTargetBitmap](rendertargetbitmap.md).

## -examples

For code examples in C#, C++/WinRT, and C++/CX, see [WriteableBitmap.PixelBuffer](writeablebitmap_pixelbuffer.md).
