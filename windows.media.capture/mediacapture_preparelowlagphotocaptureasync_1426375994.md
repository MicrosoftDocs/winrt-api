# Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoCaptureAsync

## -description
Initializes the low shutter lag photo capture and provides the [LowLagPhotoCapture](lowlagphotocapture.md) object used to manage the recording.

## -parameters
### -param type
The encoding profile used for the image.

## -returns
When this method completes, a [LowLagPhotoCapture](lowlagphotocapture.md) object is returned which can be used to start the photo capture.

## -remarks
Use [PrepareLowLagPhotoCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotocaptureasync_1426375994.md) to initialize the capture. This is an asynchronous calls which returns a [LowLagPhotoCapture](lowlagphotocapture.md) object when it is finished, which is used to start the actual photo capture by calling [LowLagPhotoCapture.CaptureAsync](lowlagphotocapture_captureasync_2078018041.md).

[PrepareLowLagPhotoCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotocaptureasync_1426375994.md) must be called before [LowLagPhotoCapture.CaptureAsync](lowlagphotocapture_captureasync_2078018041.md).
