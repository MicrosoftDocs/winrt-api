## -description
Provides data for the [AdvancedPhotoCapture.OptionalReferencePhotoCaptured](optionalreferencephotocapturedeventargs.md) event.

## -remarks
Get an instance of this class by handling the [AdvancedPhotoCapture.OptionalReferencePhotoCaptured](optionalreferencephotocapturedeventargs.md) event.

Some devices support returning a reference photo from the capture operation that can be consumed by the calling app before all image frames for the operation have been captured or processed. On devices that do not support returning a reference photo, this event is never raised.
