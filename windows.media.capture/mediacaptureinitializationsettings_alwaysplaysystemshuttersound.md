# Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCaptureInitializationSettings.AlwaysPlaySystemShutterSound

## -description
Gets a value indicating whether the system should always play a shutter sound when a photo is captured.

## -property-value
True if the system should always play a shutter sound; otherwise, false.

## -remarks
Some regions require that the system play a shutter sound whenever a photo is captured. Setting this value to true will cause the system to always play the shutter sound, whether or not is required by the current region. Setting this value to false will not suppress the system shutter sound when it is required.
