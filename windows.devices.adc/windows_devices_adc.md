# Windows.Devices.Adc

## -description
Analog-Digital Converter, or ADC, is an electrical component that converts an analog electrical signal (usually voltage) to a digital representation. ADCs usually interface a digital circuit that processes signals from analog world.

This API facilitates the consumer to read the digital representation of an analog signal which is fed to the ADC controller. This API is not standalone, it instead talks to an ADC controller through the provider interface implementation for specific breakout boards or onboard controllers.
