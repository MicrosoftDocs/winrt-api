Gets a snapshot of the flight stick state.

The current state of the flight stick.

To gather input from a flight stick, you must *poll* the flight stick using this method. The method returns a **FlightStickReading** that has information about which buttons are being pressed, the joystick's roll, pitch, and yaw, and so on. See [Reading the flight stick](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/gaming/flight-stick#reading-the-flight-stick) for more information about how to read input from a flight stick.
