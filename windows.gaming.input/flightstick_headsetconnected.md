The following example shows how to register a handler for this event.

```cppwinrt
#include <winrt/Windows.Gaming.Input.h>
using namespace winrt;
using namespace Windows::Gaming::Input;
...
FlightStick m_flightStick{ nullptr }; // Need to initialize this to a **FlightStick** that's connected to the device.
...
m_flightStick.HeadsetConnected([this](IGameController const& /* sender */, Headset const& /* args */)
    {
        // Enable headset capture and playback on this device.
    });
```

```cppcx
`flightStick` is a **FlightStick** that's connected to the device.
flightStick.HeadsetConnected += ref new TypedEventHandler<IGameController^, Headset^>(
    [] (IGameController^ device, Headset^ headset)
{
    // Enable headset capture and playback on this device.
});
```
