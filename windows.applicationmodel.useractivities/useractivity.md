# Windows.ApplicationModel.UserActivities.UserActivity

## -description

A **UserActivity** is created by an app during its execution to notify the system of a user work stream that can be continued on another device, or at another time on the same device. It provides information about a task the user is engaged in.

## -remarks

A **UserActivity** encapsulates a user's task that can be continued at a later time, and potentially on a different device. Creating a **User Activity** causes that activity to be capable of appearing in Windows Timeline and in Cortana's Pick up where I left off feature. Timeline is a rich task view that shows a chronological view of what youâ€™ve been working on, via activities that Windows believes to have had significant user engagement. It can also include what you were working on across devices. For example, a mail app could create a **UserActivity** when the user starts creating a new email message. The user could pause working on the email and then work on it later on the same machine, or even another device.
