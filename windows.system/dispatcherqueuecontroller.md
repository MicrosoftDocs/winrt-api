# Windows.System.DispatcherQueueController

## -description
Manages the lifetime of a [DispatcherQueue](dispatcherqueue.md). Provides methods to create and shutdown the **DispatcherQueue**.

## -remarks
*Object and Thread Lifetime*

**DispatcherQueueController** and its associated **DispatcherQueue** will be kept alive while the event loop is running. When **Shutdown** is completed, the loop is terminated and the dedicated thread will unwind. However,
**DispacherQueueController** and the associated **DispatcherQueue** object can outlive threadâ€™s lifetime and will be disposed when all their references are released.
