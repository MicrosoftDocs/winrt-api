# Windows.Devices.WiFiDirect.Services.WiFiDirectServiceAdvertiser.WiFiDirectServiceAdvertiser

## -description
Creates an instance of the WiFiDirectServiceAdvertiser class. To start advertising a Wi-Fi Direct Service, create an instance of this class, set its properties appropriately for your service, and then call its [Start](wifidirectserviceadvertiser_start_1587696324.md) method.

## -parameters
### -param serviceName
The name of the service to be advertised. Service names are UTF-8 strings no more than 255 characters long. It is recommended that names use reverse domain name notation, where the service owner's DNS name (such as "`contoso.com`") is reversed and used as the beginning of the service name (such as "`com.contoso.serviceX`"). This convention is intended to make it easy to choose unique service names. Service names that start with "org.wi-fi.wfds" are reserved for use by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and you may not use such names for your service.
