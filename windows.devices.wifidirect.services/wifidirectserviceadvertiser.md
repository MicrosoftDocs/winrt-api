# Windows.Devices.WiFiDirect.Services.WiFiDirectServiceAdvertiser

## -description
Represents a Service Advertiser. This class is used by code on a device that advertises Wi-Fi Direct Services, to advertise the service.

## -remarks
This is one of several classes that support connecting two devices with a preference for which device should be the Group Owner. See the [Windows.Devices.WiFiDirect.Service](windows_devices_wifidirect_services.md) topic for a discussion of device pairing and how it can cause the Group Owner preference to be ignored (and how to fix that.)

The service name is set in the [WiFiDirectServiceAdvertiser](wifidirectserviceadvertiser_wifidirectserviceadvertiser_290278668.md) constructor. Service names are UTF-8 strings no more than 255 characters long. It is recommended that names use reverse domain name notation, where the service owner's DNS name (such as "`contoso.com`") is reversed and used as the beginning of the service name (such as "`com.contoso.serviceX`"). This convention is intended to make it easy to choose unique service names. Service names that start with "org.wi-fi.wfds" are reserved for use by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and you may not use such names for your service.
