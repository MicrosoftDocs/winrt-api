## -description
Initializes the UWP XAML framework in a non-UWP desktop application (for example, a WPF or Windows Forms application) on the current thread.

> [!NOTE]
> This API is currently available as a developer preview. Although we encourage you to try out this API in your own prototype code now, we do not recommend that you use it in production code at this time. This API will continue to mature and stabilize in future Windows releases. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## -returns
An object that contains a reference to the UWP XAML framework.

## -remarks
Call this method to initialize the internal UWP XAML framework for the current thread in a desktop application in which you want to host [Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement.md) objects in a [DesktopWindowXamlSource](desktopwindowxamlsource.md). You only need to explicitly call this method if your application creates the **Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement** objects before it creates the **DesktopWindowXamlSource** object that will host them. Your application should typically should call this method when the parent UI object that hosts the **DesktopWindowXamlSource** is instantiated.

If you create a **DesktopWindowXamlSource** object before you create the **Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement** objects that will be hosted in it, you donâ€™t need to call this method. In this scenario, the UWP XAML framework will be initialized for you when you instantiate the **DesktopWindowXamlSource** object.

This method returns a [WindowsXamlManager](windowsxamlmanager.md) object that contains a reference to the UWP XAML framework. You can create as many **WindowsXamlManager** objects as you want on a given thread. However, because each object holds a reference to the UWP XAML framework, you should **Close** (**Dispose** in .NET) the objects to ensure that XAML resources are eventually released.
