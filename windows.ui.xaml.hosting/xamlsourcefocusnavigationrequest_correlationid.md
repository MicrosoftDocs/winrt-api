# Windows.UI.Xaml.Hosting.XamlSourceFocusNavigationRequest.CorrelationId

## -description

## -property-value
The unique identifier for the navigation request.

## -remarks
If you use the [XamlSourceFocusNavigationRequest](xamlsourcefocusnavigationrequest_xamlsourcefocusnavigationrequest_2111624014.md) constructor, this property returns the value you passed to the *correlationId* parameter. Otherwise, this property returns a correlation ID that was initialized by the UWP framework.
