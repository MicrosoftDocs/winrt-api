# Windows.UI.Text.ITextCharacterFormat.Weight

## -description
Gets or sets the font weight of the characters.

## -property-value
The font weight expressed as a numeric value. See Remarks.

## -remarks
In standard typography API, the weight of a font is typically expressed as a constant name, such as "Bold". Using constant names to set the Weight property is supported through type converter behaviors and by the [FontWeights](fontweights.md) support class.

The [FontWeights](fontweights.md) values correspond to the "usWeightClass" definition in the [OpenType specification](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec). The "usWeightClass" represents an integer value between 1 and 999. Lower values indicate lighter weights; higher values indicate heavier weights.
