# Windows.UI.Text.ITextCharacterFormat.Kerning

## -description
Gets or sets the minimum font size at which kerning occurs.



## -property-value
The kerning size, in floating-point points.

## -remarks
If the value is zero, kerning is turned off. Positive values turn on pair kerning for font point sizes greater than or equal to the kerning value. For example, the value 1 turns on kerning for all legible sizes, whereas 16 turns on kerning only for font sizes of 16 points and larger.
